            "description": "\nFinding the perfect crochet hook that is beautiful and functional can be a feat. We have teamed up with Ophire Co. to bring you these beautiful resin crochet hooks. Designed to be comfortable for both knife and pencil holders with a 6.25” (approximately) total length and 0.5\" diameter (at the widest point), it is not too short or too long. An in-line hook head design with a deep-seated throat prevents yarn from slipping off the hook. The pointed tip head allows you to easily stitch along.\nEach crochet hook is hand-poured and carved one by one. Each color is hand-spiraled which means each hook is completely unique—no two hooks look the same. Grab your favorite size, or the whole set, and enjoy a hook made for function, without forgetting style.\nEach hook is labeled with the mm and US size. Available in 10 sizes: 4.0mm (G-6), 4.5mm (7), 5mm (H-8), 5.5mm (I-9), 6.0mm (J-10), 6.5mm (K-10.5), 7mm, 8mm (L-11), 9mm (M/N-13), and 10mm (N/P-15). Save $20 when you purchase a full set!\nThe Azure Shimmer colorway is available exclusively at crochet.com! \nVisit Ophire Co. for more color options.\n",

With a crochet hook on one end and a knitting needle tip on the other, these hooks allow for stitches to easily be picked up and knitted from an edge by picking up a batch of stitches with the hook end and knitting them off the needle end. Similarly, they make laddering up a dropped stitch a breeze with the ability to knit off the tool after the last ladder is repaired. The Needle & Hook Multi Tool can also be used like regular crochet hooks for a faster chain bind-off, slipped stitch seams, crocheted provisional cast-ons, and crocheted edgings, making them a more versatile tool for knitters.\n\nIncluded are 16 Sunstruck laminated birch Needle & Hook Multi-Tools that are 10\" (25cm) long, with 8 sizes ranging US 8-17 (5-12mm).\n\n",

The Needle & Hook Multi Tool can also be used like regular crochet hooks for a faster chain bind-off, slipped stitch seams, crocheted provisional cast-ons, and crocheted edgings, making them a more versatile tool for knitters.\n\nIncluded are 16 Sunstruck laminated birch Needle & Hook Multi-Tools that are 10\" (25cm) long, with 8 sizes ranging US 8-17 (5-12mm).\n\n",
