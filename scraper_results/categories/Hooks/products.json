With a crochet hook on one end and a knitting needle tip on the other, these hooks allow for stitches to easily be picked up and knitted from an edge by picking up a batch of stitches with the hook end and knitting them off the needle end. Similarly, they make laddering up a dropped stitch a breeze with the ability to knit off the tool after the last ladder is repaired. The Needle & Hook Multi Tool can also be used like regular crochet hooks for a faster chain bind-off, slipped stitch seams, crocheted provisional cast-ons, and crocheted edgings, making them a more versatile tool for knitters.\n\nIncluded are 16 Sunstruck laminated birch Needle & Hook Multi-Tools that are 10\" (25cm) long, with 8 sizes ranging US 8-17 (5-12mm).\n\n",

Similarly, they make laddering up a dropped stitch a breeze with the ability to knit off the tool after the last ladder is repaired. The Needle & Hook Multi Tool can also be used like regular crochet hooks for a faster chain bind-off, slipped stitch seams, crocheted provisional cast-ons, and crocheted edgings, making them a more versatile tool for knitters.\n\nIncluded are 16 Sunstruck laminated birch Needle & Hook Multi-Tools that are 10\" (25cm) long, with 8 sizes ranging US 8-17 (5-12mm).\n\n",
