That's the case with Whoopsland, our first attempt at creating a tweed-free version of our beloved Woodland yarn. This luxurious blend of 80% merino and 20% alpaca strikes the perfect balance between rustic charm and refined elegance. With just enough alpaca to add warmth and softness, this Merino-based yarn is ideal for winter wear and gentle enough for next-to-skin projects. Its loose, gentle twist provides excellent thermal efficiency, drape, and stitch definition.\n\nDuring production, we found that this tweed-free version had slightly more pilling than expected post-dyeing. Rather than letting it go to waste, we’re offering it at a special discounted price, letting you enjoy premium yarn at an exceptional value.\n\nDespite the minor pilling, the high Merino content ensures superb stitch definition, making it perfect for textured or cabled designs, whether you're aiming for a cottage-core vibe or a more classic style. This limited-edition yarn is soft enough for accessories and versatile enough for a variety of projects. Don’t miss your chance to experience Whoopsland—a premium yarn with a bit of added character, available at a budget-friendly price.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Yarn Details\n                    Plus Icon\nMinus Icon\n\n\n\n\nFiber Content:                     80% Merino Wool, 20% Baby Alpaca\n                \nWeight: Aran/Heavy Worsted\n\nKnitting Gauge:                     4 - 4.75 sts = 1\" on #7 - 9 needles (4.5mm-5.5mm)\n                \nCrochet Gauge:                     11-14 sc = 4'' on I - K hooks (5.5 mm-6.5 mm)\n                \nYards:                     180\n                \nGrams:                     100\n                \nPut Up:                     Hank\n                \nCare:                     Hand Wash Cold / Lay Flat to Dry\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Care Instructions\n                    Plus Icon\nMinus Icon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

That's the case with Whoopsland, our first attempt at creating a tweed-free version of our beloved Woodland yarn. This luxurious blend of 80% merino and 20% alpaca strikes the perfect balance between rustic charm and refined elegance. With just enough alpaca to add warmth and softness, this Merino-based yarn is ideal for winter wear and gentle enough for next-to-skin projects. Its loose, gentle twist provides excellent thermal efficiency, drape, and stitch definition.\n\nDuring production, we found that this tweed-free version had slightly more pilling than expected post-dyeing. Rather than letting it go to waste, we’re offering it at a special discounted price, letting you enjoy premium yarn at an exceptional value.\n\nDespite the minor pilling, the high Merino content ensures superb stitch definition, making it perfect for textured or cabled designs, whether you're aiming for a cottage-core vibe or a more classic style. This limited-edition yarn is soft enough for accessories and versatile enough for a variety of projects. Don’t miss your chance to experience Whoopsland—a premium yarn with a bit of added character, available at a budget-friendly price.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Yarn Details\n                    Plus Icon\nMinus Icon\n\n\n\n\nFiber Content:                     80% Merino Wool, 20% Baby Alpaca\n                \nWeight: Aran/Heavy Worsted\n\nKnitting Gauge:                     4 - 4.75 sts = 1\" on #7 - 9 needles (4.5mm-5.5mm)\n                \nCrochet Gauge:                     11-14 sc = 4'' on I - K hooks (5.5 mm-6.5 mm)\n                \nYards:                     180\n                \nGrams:                     100\n                \nPut Up:                     Hank\n                \nCare:                     Hand Wash Cold / Lay Flat to Dry\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Care Instructions\n                    Plus Icon\nMinus Icon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Bluefaced Leicester provides luster, drape, and durability; Masham provides a hint of sheen and loftiness; and Merino provides luxurious softness. This luxury British breed blend is a staple yarn in any stash, with each shade inspired by English woodland. This soft yarn is comfortably worn next to the skin, making it ideal for sweaters, scarves, and hats.\nBluefaced Leicester: Evolved during the last century in the Tyne & Wear Valleys and the hills of east Cumbria, this breed produces fine, long-staple wool that is known for its softness and luster. As well as being soft, this fiber also holds the strength needed to create long-lasting garments that can be treasured over time. With a broad muzzle and tightly curled, semi-lustrous wool, it is the dark blue skin on the sheep’s head that gave the breed its name.\nMasham: Produced by crossing a Teeswater or Wensleydale ram with a Northern hill ewe such as the Swaledale or Dalesbred, this hardy sheep produces a soft, demi-luster fleece.\nMerino: Developed in Spain, Merino sheep are world famous for having one of the highest quality fleece of any breed of sheep. The short and fine fibers used in Merino yarn create a luxurious and soft texture that has all the resilience needed to create a long-lasting piece of knitwear.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Yarn Details\n                    Plus Icon\nMinus Icon\n\n\n\n\nFiber Content:                     34% Blue Faced Leicester, 33% Masham, 33% Merino\n                \nWeight: Aran/Heavy Worsted\n\nKnitting Gauge:                     4 - 4.75 sts = 1\" on #7 - 9 needles (4.5mm-5.5mm)\n                \nCrochet Gauge:                     11 -14 sc = 4'' on I - K hooks (5.5mm-6.5mm)\n                \nYards:                     168\n                \nGrams:                     100\n                \nPut Up:                     Hank\n                \nCare:                     Hand Wash / Dry Flat\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Care Instructions\n                    Plus Icon\nMinus Icon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

With its exceptional warmth, softness, durability, and versatility, this blend offers stitchers the opportunity to create beautiful, long-lasting garments and accessories that are as stylish as they are comfortable. \n\nBy combining kid mohair with merino wool, we have created a yarn that not only feels luxurious but also boasts exceptional durability and wearability. Mohair's fine fibers, when blended with merino wool, result in a yarn that is stronger and more resilient than pure mohair. This ensures that the knitted items retain their shape and integrity even after repeated use and washing.\nWhether crafting cozy winter sweaters, lightweight summer tops, or stylish accessories, our blend offers the perfect balance of warmth, breathability, and comfort for year-round wear.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Yarn Details\n                    Plus Icon\nMinus Icon\n\n\n\n\nFiber Content:                     75% Merino Wool, 25% Kid Mohair\n                \nWeight: DK\n\nKnitting Gauge:                     5.5 - 6 sts =1\" on #4 - 7 needles (3.5mm - 4.5mm)\n                \nCrochet Gauge:                     13 - 18 sts = 4\" on 7-I hooks (4.5mm - 5.5mm)\n                \nYards:                     273\n                \nGrams:                     100\n                \nPut Up:                     Hank\n                \nCare:                     Hand Wash Cold / Lay Flat to Dry\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Care Instructions\n                    Plus Icon\nMinus Icon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Bluefaced Leicester provides luster, drape, and durability; Masham provides a hint of sheen and loftiness; and Merino provides luxurious softness. This luxury British breed blend is a staple yarn in any stash, with each shade inspired by English woodland. This soft yarn is comfortably worn next to the skin, making it ideal for sweaters, scarves, and hats.\nBluefaced Leicester: Evolved during the last century in the Tyne & Wear Valleys and the hills of east Cumbria, this breed produces fine, long-staple wool that is known for its softness and luster. As well as being soft, this fiber also holds the strength needed to create long-lasting garments that can be treasured over time. With a broad muzzle and tightly curled, semi-lustrous wool, it is the dark blue skin on the sheep’s head that gave the breed its name.\nMasham: Produced by crossing a Teeswater or Wensleydale ram with a Northern hill ewe such as the Swaledale or Dalesbred, this hardy sheep produces a soft, demi-luster fleece.\nMerino: Developed in Spain, Merino sheep are world famous for having one of the highest quality fleece of any breed of sheep. The short and fine fibers used in Merino yarn create a luxurious and soft texture that has all the resilience needed to create a long-lasting piece of knitwear.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Yarn Details\n                    Plus Icon\nMinus Icon\n\n\n\n\nFiber Content:                     34% Blue Faced Leicester, 33% Masham, 33% Merino\n                \nWeight: Aran/Heavy Worsted\n\nKnitting Gauge:                     4 - 4.75 sts = 1\" on #7 - 9 needles (4.5mm-5.5mm)\n                \nCrochet Gauge:                     11 -14 sc = 4'' on I - K hooks (5.5mm-6.5mm)\n                \nYards:                     168\n                \nGrams:                     100\n                \nPut Up:                     Hank\n                \nCare:                     Hand Wash / Dry Flat\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Care Instructions\n                    Plus Icon\nMinus Icon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

With its exceptional warmth, softness, durability, and versatility, this blend offers stitchers the opportunity to create beautiful, long-lasting garments and accessories that are as stylish as they are comfortable. \n\nBy combining kid mohair with merino wool, we have created a yarn that not only feels luxurious but also boasts exceptional durability and wearability. Mohair's fine fibers, when blended with merino wool, result in a yarn that is stronger and more resilient than pure mohair. This ensures that the knitted items retain their shape and integrity even after repeated use and washing.\nWhether crafting cozy winter sweaters, lightweight summer tops, or stylish accessories, our blend offers the perfect balance of warmth, breathability, and comfort for year-round wear.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Yarn Details\n                    Plus Icon\nMinus Icon\n\n\n\n\nFiber Content:                     75% Merino Wool, 25% Kid Mohair\n                \nWeight: DK\n\nKnitting Gauge:                     5.5 - 6 sts =1\" on #4 - 7 needles (3.5mm - 4.5mm)\n                \nCrochet Gauge:                     13 - 18 sts = 4\" on 7-I hooks (4.5mm - 5.5mm)\n                \nYards:                     273\n                \nGrams:                     100\n                \nPut Up:                     Hank\n                \nCare:                     Hand Wash Cold / Lay Flat to Dry\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Care Instructions\n                    Plus Icon\nMinus Icon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

The shades in this range are inspired by fishermen and the coastline. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Yarn Details\n                    Plus Icon\nMinus Icon\n\n\n\n\nFiber Content:                     100% British Wool\n                \nWeight: Aran/Heavy Worsted\n\nKnitting Gauge:                     4 - 4.75 sts = 1\" on #7 - 9 needles (4.5mm-5.5mm)\n                \nCrochet Gauge:                     11 -14 sc = 4'' on I - K hooks (5.5mm-6.5mm)\n                \nYards:                     336\n                \nGrams:                     200\n                \nPut Up:                     Hank\n                \nCare:                     Hand Wash / Dry Flat\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Care Instructions\n                    Plus Icon\nMinus Icon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Bluefaced Leicester provides luster, drape, and durability; Masham provides a hint of sheen and loftiness; and Merino provides luxurious softness. This luxury British breed blend is a staple yarn in any stash, with each shade inspired by English woodland. This soft yarn is comfortably worn next to the skin, making it ideal for sweaters, scarves, and hats.\nBluefaced Leicester: Evolved during the last century in the Tyne & Wear Valleys and the hills of east Cumbria, this breed produces fine, long-staple wool that is known for its softness and luster. As well as being soft, this fiber also holds the strength needed to create long-lasting garments that can be treasured over time. With a broad muzzle and tightly curled, semi-lustrous wool, it is the dark blue skin on the sheep’s head that gave the breed its name.\nMasham: Produced by crossing a Teeswater or Wensleydale ram with a Northern hill ewe such as the Swaledale or Dalesbred, this hardy sheep produces a soft, demi-luster fleece.\nMerino: Developed in Spain, Merino sheep are world famous for having one of the highest quality fleece of any breed of sheep. The short and fine fibers used in Merino yarn create a luxurious and soft texture that has all the resilience needed to create a long-lasting piece of knitwear.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Yarn Details\n                    Plus Icon\nMinus Icon\n\n\n\n\nFiber Content:                     34% Blue Faced Leicester, 33% Masham, 33% Merino\n                \nWeight: Aran/Heavy Worsted\n\nKnitting Gauge:                     4 - 4.75 sts = 1\" on #7 - 9 needles (4.5mm-5.5mm)\n                \nCrochet Gauge:                     11 -14 sc = 4'' on I - K hooks (5.5mm-6.5mm)\n                \nYards:                     168\n                \nGrams:                     100\n                \nPut Up:                     Hank\n                \nCare:                     Hand Wash / Dry Flat\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Care Instructions\n                    Plus Icon\nMinus Icon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

With its exceptional warmth, softness, durability, and versatility, this blend offers stitchers the opportunity to create beautiful, long-lasting garments and accessories that are as stylish as they are comfortable. \n\nBy combining kid mohair with merino wool, we have created a yarn that not only feels luxurious but also boasts exceptional durability and wearability. Mohair's fine fibers, when blended with merino wool, result in a yarn that is stronger and more resilient than pure mohair. This ensures that the knitted items retain their shape and integrity even after repeated use and washing.\nWhether crafting cozy winter sweaters, lightweight summer tops, or stylish accessories, our blend offers the perfect balance of warmth, breathability, and comfort for year-round wear.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Yarn Details\n                    Plus Icon\nMinus Icon\n\n\n\n\nFiber Content:                     75% Merino Wool, 25% Kid Mohair\n                \nWeight: DK\n\nKnitting Gauge:                     5.5 - 6 sts =1\" on #4 - 7 needles (3.5mm - 4.5mm)\n                \nCrochet Gauge:                     13 - 18 sts = 4\" on 7-I hooks (4.5mm - 5.5mm)\n                \nYards:                     273\n                \nGrams:                     100\n                \nPut Up:                     Hank\n                \nCare:                     Hand Wash Cold / Lay Flat to Dry\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Care Instructions\n                    Plus Icon\nMinus Icon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

The wonderfully soft and touchable Merino is firmly twisted in a single strand, stable enough to discourage splitting and pilling, while still enjoying the finish and drape of single-ply construction—with special care taken to ensure even thickness. At approx. 8 wraps per inch, the yard-to-weight ratio can be deceiving, with extra weight from the dense twist knitting into a satisfying and substantial fabric. With machine washable convenience, you'll enjoy easy care hats, cowls, and accessories with next-to-skin softness, or sweaters and garments bursting with color.\n\nMeticulously hand-dyed by artisans, each skein of Muse is a study in the art of masterful color blending. The multi-colored hand-painted colorways are achieved by the blending of just 3 basic colors, applied with precision, which minimizes the streaking and pooling other hand-painted yarns are prone to. Functioning almost as solids, our tonal varieties are ideal for use in projects that feature textural stitches and cables, as the subtle variations in tone emphasize stitches and bring extra depth.\n\nPlease note: As a hand-painted yarn, colors may vary from skein to skein.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Yarn Details\n                    Plus Icon\nMinus Icon\n\n\n\n\nFiber Content:                     100% Superwash Merino Wool\n                \nWeight: Aran/Heavy Worsted\n\nKnitting Gauge:                     4 - 4.5 sts = 1\" on #7 -10 needles (4.5mm-5.5mm)\n                \nCrochet Gauge:                     11 - 14 sts sc = 4\"on I - K hooks\n                \nYards:                     114\n                \nGrams:                     100\n                \nPut Up:                     Hank\n                \nCare:                     Machine Wash Gentle Cold / Tumble Dry Low\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Care Instructions\n                    Plus Icon\nMinus Icon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Bluefaced Leicester provides luster, drape, and durability; Masham provides a hint of sheen and loftiness; and Merino provides luxurious softness. This luxury British breed blend is a staple yarn in any stash, with each shade inspired by English woodland. This soft yarn is comfortably worn next to the skin, making it ideal for sweaters, scarves, and hats.\nBluefaced Leicester: Evolved during the last century in the Tyne & Wear Valleys and the hills of east Cumbria, this breed produces fine, long-staple wool that is known for its softness and luster. As well as being soft, this fiber also holds the strength needed to create long-lasting garments that can be treasured over time. With a broad muzzle and tightly curled, semi-lustrous wool, it is the dark blue skin on the sheep’s head that gave the breed its name.\nMasham: Produced by crossing a Teeswater or Wensleydale ram with a Northern hill ewe such as the Swaledale or Dalesbred, this hardy sheep produces a soft, demi-luster fleece.\nMerino: Developed in Spain, Merino sheep are world famous for having one of the highest quality fleece of any breed of sheep. The short and fine fibers used in Merino yarn create a luxurious and soft texture that has all the resilience needed to create a long-lasting piece of knitwear.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Yarn Details\n                    Plus Icon\nMinus Icon\n\n\n\n\nFiber Content:                     34% Blue Faced Leicester, 33% Masham, 33% Merino\n                \nWeight: Aran/Heavy Worsted\n\nKnitting Gauge:                     4 - 4.75 sts = 1\" on #7 - 9 needles (4.5mm-5.5mm)\n                \nCrochet Gauge:                     11 -14 sc = 4'' on I - K hooks (5.5mm-6.5mm)\n                \nYards:                     168\n                \nGrams:                     100\n                \nPut Up:                     Hank\n                \nCare:                     Hand Wash / Dry Flat\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Care Instructions\n                    Plus Icon\nMinus Icon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

The wonderfully soft and touchable Merino is firmly twisted in a single strand, stable enough to discourage splitting and pilling, while still enjoying the finish and drape of single-ply construction—with special care taken to ensure even thickness. At approx. 8 wraps per inch, the yard-to-weight ratio can be deceiving, with extra weight from the dense twist knitting into a satisfying and substantial fabric. With machine washable convenience, you'll enjoy easy care hats, cowls, and accessories with next-to-skin softness, or sweaters and garments bursting with color.\n\nMeticulously hand-dyed by artisans, each skein of Muse is a study in the art of masterful color blending. The multi-colored hand-painted colorways are achieved by the blending of just 3 basic colors, applied with precision, which minimizes the streaking and pooling other hand-painted yarns are prone to. Functioning almost as solids, our tonal varieties are ideal for use in projects that feature textural stitches and cables, as the subtle variations in tone emphasize stitches and bring extra depth.\n\nPlease note: As a hand-painted yarn, colors may vary from skein to skein.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Yarn Details\n                    Plus Icon\nMinus Icon\n\n\n\n\nFiber Content:                     100% Superwash Merino Wool\n                \nWeight: Aran/Heavy Worsted\n\nKnitting Gauge:                     4 - 4.5 sts = 1\" on #7 -10 needles (4.5mm-5.5mm)\n                \nCrochet Gauge:                     11 - 14 sts sc = 4\"on I - K hooks\n                \nYards:                     114\n                \nGrams:                     100\n                \nPut Up:                     Hank\n                \nCare:                     Machine Wash Gentle Cold / Tumble Dry Low\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Care Instructions\n                    Plus Icon\nMinus Icon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

With its exceptional warmth, softness, durability, and versatility, this blend offers stitchers the opportunity to create beautiful, long-lasting garments and accessories that are as stylish as they are comfortable. \n\nBy combining kid mohair with merino wool, we have created a yarn that not only feels luxurious but also boasts exceptional durability and wearability. Mohair's fine fibers, when blended with merino wool, result in a yarn that is stronger and more resilient than pure mohair. This ensures that the knitted items retain their shape and integrity even after repeated use and washing.\nWhether crafting cozy winter sweaters, lightweight summer tops, or stylish accessories, our blend offers the perfect balance of warmth, breathability, and comfort for year-round wear.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Yarn Details\n                    Plus Icon\nMinus Icon\n\n\n\n\nFiber Content:                     75% Merino Wool, 25% Kid Mohair\n                \nWeight: DK\n\nKnitting Gauge:                     5.5 - 6 sts =1\" on #4 - 7 needles (3.5mm - 4.5mm)\n                \nCrochet Gauge:                     13 - 18 sts = 4\" on 7-I hooks (4.5mm - 5.5mm)\n                \nYards:                     273\n                \nGrams:                     100\n                \nPut Up:                     Hank\n                \nCare:                     Hand Wash Cold / Lay Flat to Dry\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Care Instructions\n                    Plus Icon\nMinus Icon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

The wonderfully soft and touchable Merino is firmly twisted in a single strand, stable enough to discourage splitting and pilling, while still enjoying the finish and drape of single-ply construction—with special care taken to ensure even thickness. At approx. 8 wraps per inch, the yard-to-weight ratio can be deceiving, with extra weight from the dense twist knitting into a satisfying and substantial fabric. With machine washable convenience, you'll enjoy easy care hats, cowls, and accessories with next-to-skin softness, or sweaters and garments bursting with color.\n\nMeticulously hand-dyed by artisans, each skein of Muse is a study in the art of masterful color blending. The multi-colored hand-painted colorways are achieved by the blending of just 3 basic colors, applied with precision, which minimizes the streaking and pooling other hand-painted yarns are prone to. Functioning almost as solids, our tonal varieties are ideal for use in projects that feature textural stitches and cables, as the subtle variations in tone emphasize stitches and bring extra depth.\n\nPlease note: As a hand-painted yarn, colors may vary from skein to skein.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Yarn Details\n                    Plus Icon\nMinus Icon\n\n\n\n\nFiber Content:                     100% Superwash Merino Wool\n                \nWeight: Aran/Heavy Worsted\n\nKnitting Gauge:                     4 - 4.5 sts = 1\" on #7 -10 needles (4.5mm-5.5mm)\n                \nCrochet Gauge:                     11 - 14 sts sc = 4\"on I - K hooks\n                \nYards:                     114\n                \nGrams:                     100\n                \nPut Up:                     Hank\n                \nCare:                     Machine Wash Gentle Cold / Tumble Dry Low\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Care Instructions\n                    Plus Icon\nMinus Icon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

The wonderfully soft and touchable Merino is firmly twisted in a single strand, stable enough to discourage splitting and pilling, while still enjoying the finish and drape of single-ply construction—with special care taken to ensure even thickness. At approx. 8 wraps per inch, the yard-to-weight ratio can be deceiving, with extra weight from the dense twist knitting into a satisfying and substantial fabric. With machine washable convenience, you'll enjoy easy care hats, cowls, and accessories with next-to-skin softness, or sweaters and garments bursting with color.\n\nMeticulously hand-dyed by artisans, each skein of Muse is a study in the art of masterful color blending. The multi-colored hand-painted colorways are achieved by the blending of just 3 basic colors, applied with precision, which minimizes the streaking and pooling other hand-painted yarns are prone to. Functioning almost as solids, our tonal varieties are ideal for use in projects that feature textural stitches and cables, as the subtle variations in tone emphasize stitches and bring extra depth.\n\nPlease note: As a hand-painted yarn, colors may vary from skein to skein.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Yarn Details\n                    Plus Icon\nMinus Icon\n\n\n\n\nFiber Content:                     100% Superwash Merino Wool\n                \nWeight: Aran/Heavy Worsted\n\nKnitting Gauge:                     4 - 4.5 sts = 1\" on #7 -10 needles (4.5mm-5.5mm)\n                \nCrochet Gauge:                     11 - 14 sts sc = 4\"on I - K hooks\n                \nYards:                     114\n                \nGrams:                     100\n                \nPut Up:                     Hank\n                \nCare:                     Machine Wash Gentle Cold / Tumble Dry Low\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Care Instructions\n                    Plus Icon\nMinus Icon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

The wonderfully soft and touchable Merino is firmly twisted in a single strand, stable enough to discourage splitting and pilling, while still enjoying the finish and drape of single-ply construction—with special care taken to ensure even thickness. At approx. 8 wraps per inch, the yard-to-weight ratio can be deceiving, with extra weight from the dense twist knitting into a satisfying and substantial fabric. With machine washable convenience, you'll enjoy easy care hats, cowls, and accessories with next-to-skin softness, or sweaters and garments bursting with color.\n\nMeticulously hand-dyed by artisans, each skein of Muse is a study in the art of masterful color blending. The multi-colored hand-painted colorways are achieved by the blending of just 3 basic colors, applied with precision, which minimizes the streaking and pooling other hand-painted yarns are prone to. Functioning almost as solids, our tonal varieties are ideal for use in projects that feature textural stitches and cables, as the subtle variations in tone emphasize stitches and bring extra depth.\n\nPlease note: As a hand-painted yarn, colors may vary from skein to skein.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Yarn Details\n                    Plus Icon\nMinus Icon\n\n\n\n\nFiber Content:                     100% Superwash Merino Wool\n                \nWeight: Aran/Heavy Worsted\n\nKnitting Gauge:                     4 - 4.5 sts = 1\" on #7 -10 needles (4.5mm-5.5mm)\n                \nCrochet Gauge:                     11 - 14 sts sc = 4\"on I - K hooks\n                \nYards:                     114\n                \nGrams:                     100\n                \nPut Up:                     Hank\n                \nCare:                     Machine Wash Gentle Cold / Tumble Dry Low\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Care Instructions\n                    Plus Icon\nMinus Icon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Bluefaced Leicester provides luster, drape, and durability; Masham provides a hint of sheen and loftiness; and Merino provides luxurious softness. This luxury British breed blend is a staple yarn in any stash, with each shade inspired by English woodland. This soft yarn is comfortably worn next to the skin, making it ideal for sweaters, scarves, and hats.\nBluefaced Leicester: Evolved during the last century in the Tyne & Wear Valleys and the hills of east Cumbria, this breed produces fine, long-staple wool that is known for its softness and luster. As well as being soft, this fiber also holds the strength needed to create long-lasting garments that can be treasured over time. With a broad muzzle and tightly curled, semi-lustrous wool, it is the dark blue skin on the sheep’s head that gave the breed its name.\nMasham: Produced by crossing a Teeswater or Wensleydale ram with a Northern hill ewe such as the Swaledale or Dalesbred, this hardy sheep produces a soft, demi-luster fleece.\nMerino: Developed in Spain, Merino sheep are world famous for having one of the highest quality fleece of any breed of sheep. The short and fine fibers used in Merino yarn create a luxurious and soft texture that has all the resilience needed to create a long-lasting piece of knitwear.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Yarn Details\n                    Plus Icon\nMinus Icon\n\n\n\n\nFiber Content:                     34% Blue Faced Leicester, 33% Masham, 33% Merino\n                \nWeight: Aran/Heavy Worsted\n\nKnitting Gauge:                     4 - 4.75 sts = 1\" on #7 - 9 needles (4.5mm-5.5mm)\n                \nCrochet Gauge:                     11 -14 sc = 4'' on I - K hooks (5.5mm-6.5mm)\n                \nYards:                     168\n                \nGrams:                     100\n                \nPut Up:                     Hank\n                \nCare:                     Hand Wash / Dry Flat\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Care Instructions\n                    Plus Icon\nMinus Icon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Aran yarn has always been worsted spun and hank dyed—this yarn line follows these traditional methods with an additional organic-based softener that’s applied after dying. The shades in this range are inspired by fishermen and the coastline. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Yarn Details\n                    Plus Icon\nMinus Icon\n\n\n\n\nFiber Content:                     100% British Wool\n                \nWeight: Aran/Heavy Worsted\n\nKnitting Gauge:                     4 - 4.75 sts = 1\" on #7 - 9 needles (4.5mm-5.5mm)\n                \nCrochet Gauge:                     11 -14 sc = 4'' on I - K hooks (5.5mm-6.5mm)\n                \nYards:                     336\n                \nGrams:                     200\n                \nPut Up:                     Hank\n                \nCare:                     Hand Wash / Dry Flat\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Care Instructions\n                    Plus Icon\nMinus Icon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

The wonderfully soft and touchable Merino is firmly twisted in a single strand, stable enough to discourage splitting and pilling, while still enjoying the finish and drape of single-ply construction—with special care taken to ensure even thickness. At approx. 8 wraps per inch, the yard-to-weight ratio can be deceiving, with extra weight from the dense twist knitting into a satisfying and substantial fabric. With machine washable convenience, you'll enjoy easy care hats, cowls, and accessories with next-to-skin softness, or sweaters and garments bursting with color.\n\nMeticulously hand-dyed by artisans, each skein of Muse is a study in the art of masterful color blending. The multi-colored hand-painted colorways are achieved by the blending of just 3 basic colors, applied with precision, which minimizes the streaking and pooling other hand-painted yarns are prone to. Functioning almost as solids, our tonal varieties are ideal for use in projects that feature textural stitches and cables, as the subtle variations in tone emphasize stitches and bring extra depth.\n\nPlease note: As a hand-painted yarn, colors may vary from skein to skein.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Yarn Details\n                    Plus Icon\nMinus Icon\n\n\n\n\nFiber Content:                     100% Superwash Merino Wool\n                \nWeight: Aran/Heavy Worsted\n\nKnitting Gauge:                     4 - 4.5 sts = 1\" on #7 -10 needles (4.5mm-5.5mm)\n                \nCrochet Gauge:                     11 - 14 sts sc = 4\"on I - K hooks\n                \nYards:                     114\n                \nGrams:                     100\n                \nPut Up:                     Hank\n                \nCare:                     Machine Wash Gentle Cold / Tumble Dry Low\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Care Instructions\n                    Plus Icon\nMinus Icon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

The wonderfully soft and touchable Merino is firmly twisted in a single strand, stable enough to discourage splitting and pilling, while still enjoying the finish and drape of single-ply construction—with special care taken to ensure even thickness. At approx. 8 wraps per inch, the yard-to-weight ratio can be deceiving, with extra weight from the dense twist knitting into a satisfying and substantial fabric. With machine washable convenience, you'll enjoy easy care hats, cowls, and accessories with next-to-skin softness, or sweaters and garments bursting with color.\n\nMeticulously hand-dyed by artisans, each skein of Muse is a study in the art of masterful color blending. The multi-colored hand-painted colorways are achieved by the blending of just 3 basic colors, applied with precision, which minimizes the streaking and pooling other hand-painted yarns are prone to. Functioning almost as solids, our tonal varieties are ideal for use in projects that feature textural stitches and cables, as the subtle variations in tone emphasize stitches and bring extra depth.\n\nPlease note: As a hand-painted yarn, colors may vary from skein to skein.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Yarn Details\n                    Plus Icon\nMinus Icon\n\n\n\n\nFiber Content:                     100% Superwash Merino Wool\n                \nWeight: Aran/Heavy Worsted\n\nKnitting Gauge:                     4 - 4.5 sts = 1\" on #7 -10 needles (4.5mm-5.5mm)\n                \nCrochet Gauge:                     11 - 14 sts sc = 4\"on I - K hooks\n                \nYards:                     114\n                \nGrams:                     100\n                \nPut Up:                     Hank\n                \nCare:                     Machine Wash Gentle Cold / Tumble Dry Low\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Care Instructions\n                    Plus Icon\nMinus Icon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

The wonderfully soft and touchable Merino is firmly twisted in a single strand, stable enough to discourage splitting and pilling, while still enjoying the finish and drape of single-ply construction—with special care taken to ensure even thickness. At approx. 8 wraps per inch, the yard-to-weight ratio can be deceiving, with extra weight from the dense twist knitting into a satisfying and substantial fabric. With machine washable convenience, you'll enjoy easy care hats, cowls, and accessories with next-to-skin softness, or sweaters and garments bursting with color.\n\nMeticulously hand-dyed by artisans, each skein of Muse is a study in the art of masterful color blending. The multi-colored hand-painted colorways are achieved by the blending of just 3 basic colors, applied with precision, which minimizes the streaking and pooling other hand-painted yarns are prone to. Functioning almost as solids, our tonal varieties are ideal for use in projects that feature textural stitches and cables, as the subtle variations in tone emphasize stitches and bring extra depth.\n\nPlease note: As a hand-painted yarn, colors may vary from skein to skein.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Yarn Details\n                    Plus Icon\nMinus Icon\n\n\n\n\nFiber Content:                     100% Superwash Merino Wool\n                \nWeight: Aran/Heavy Worsted\n\nKnitting Gauge:                     4 - 4.5 sts = 1\" on #7 -10 needles (4.5mm-5.5mm)\n                \nCrochet Gauge:                     11 - 14 sts sc = 4\"on I - K hooks\n                \nYards:                     114\n                \nGrams:                     100\n                \nPut Up:                     Hank\n                \nCare:                     Machine Wash Gentle Cold / Tumble Dry Low\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Care Instructions\n                    Plus Icon\nMinus Icon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

The wonderfully soft and touchable Merino is firmly twisted in a single strand, stable enough to discourage splitting and pilling, while still enjoying the finish and drape of single-ply construction—with special care taken to ensure even thickness. At approx. 8 wraps per inch, the yard-to-weight ratio can be deceiving, with extra weight from the dense twist knitting into a satisfying and substantial fabric. With machine washable convenience, you'll enjoy easy care hats, cowls, and accessories with next-to-skin softness, or sweaters and garments bursting with color.\n\nMeticulously hand-dyed by artisans, each skein of Muse is a study in the art of masterful color blending. The multi-colored hand-painted colorways are achieved by the blending of just 3 basic colors, applied with precision, which minimizes the streaking and pooling other hand-painted yarns are prone to. Functioning almost as solids, our tonal varieties are ideal for use in projects that feature textural stitches and cables, as the subtle variations in tone emphasize stitches and bring extra depth.\n\nPlease note: As a hand-painted yarn, colors may vary from skein to skein.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Yarn Details\n                    Plus Icon\nMinus Icon\n\n\n\n\nFiber Content:                     100% Superwash Merino Wool\n                \nWeight: Aran/Heavy Worsted\n\nKnitting Gauge:                     4 - 4.5 sts = 1\" on #7 -10 needles (4.5mm-5.5mm)\n                \nCrochet Gauge:                     11 - 14 sts sc = 4\"on I - K hooks\n                \nYards:                     114\n                \nGrams:                     100\n                \nPut Up:                     Hank\n                \nCare:                     Machine Wash Gentle Cold / Tumble Dry Low\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Care Instructions\n                    Plus Icon\nMinus Icon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Bluefaced Leicester provides luster, drape, and durability; Masham provides a hint of sheen and loftiness; and Merino provides luxurious softness. This luxury British breed blend is a staple yarn in any stash, with each shade inspired by English woodland. This soft yarn is comfortably worn next to the skin, making it ideal for sweaters, scarves, and hats.\nBluefaced Leicester: Evolved during the last century in the Tyne & Wear Valleys and the hills of east Cumbria, this breed produces fine, long-staple wool that is known for its softness and luster. As well as being soft, this fiber also holds the strength needed to create long-lasting garments that can be treasured over time. With a broad muzzle and tightly curled, semi-lustrous wool, it is the dark blue skin on the sheep’s head that gave the breed its name.\nMasham: Produced by crossing a Teeswater or Wensleydale ram with a Northern hill ewe such as the Swaledale or Dalesbred, this hardy sheep produces a soft, demi-luster fleece.\nMerino: Developed in Spain, Merino sheep are world famous for having one of the highest quality fleece of any breed of sheep. The short and fine fibers used in Merino yarn create a luxurious and soft texture that has all the resilience needed to create a long-lasting piece of knitwear.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Yarn Details\n                    Plus Icon\nMinus Icon\n\n\n\n\nFiber Content:                     34% Blue Faced Leicester, 33% Masham, 33% Merino\n                \nWeight: Aran/Heavy Worsted\n\nKnitting Gauge:                     4 - 4.75 sts = 1\" on #7 - 9 needles (4.5mm-5.5mm)\n                \nCrochet Gauge:                     11 -14 sc = 4'' on I - K hooks (5.5mm-6.5mm)\n                \nYards:                     168\n                \nGrams:                     100\n                \nPut Up:                     Hank\n                \nCare:                     Hand Wash / Dry Flat\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Care Instructions\n                    Plus Icon\nMinus Icon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

It is then scoured, spun, and dyed in the UK, with a small amount dyed by specialist dyers in Europe.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Yarn Details\n                    Plus Icon\nMinus Icon\n\n\n\n\nFiber Content:                     100% British Wool\n                \nWeight: Sport\n\nKnitting Gauge:                     6 sts = 1\" on #3 - 5 needles (3.25mm - 3.75mm)\n                \nCrochet Gauge:                     16 - 20 sc = 4'' on E-7 hooks\n                \nYards:                     240\n                \nGrams:                     100\n                \nPut Up:                     Ball\n                \nCare:                     Hand Wash / Dry Flat\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Care Instructions\n                    Plus Icon\nMinus Icon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Bluefaced Leicester provides luster, drape, and durability; Masham provides a hint of sheen and loftiness; and Merino provides luxurious softness. This luxury British breed blend is a staple yarn in any stash, with each shade inspired by English woodland. This soft yarn is comfortably worn next to the skin, making it ideal for sweaters, scarves, and hats.\nBluefaced Leicester: Evolved during the last century in the Tyne & Wear Valleys and the hills of east Cumbria, this breed produces fine, long-staple wool that is known for its softness and luster. As well as being soft, this fiber also holds the strength needed to create long-lasting garments that can be treasured over time. With a broad muzzle and tightly curled, semi-lustrous wool, it is the dark blue skin on the sheep’s head that gave the breed its name.\nMasham: Produced by crossing a Teeswater or Wensleydale ram with a Northern hill ewe such as the Swaledale or Dalesbred, this hardy sheep produces a soft, demi-luster fleece.\nMerino: Developed in Spain, Merino sheep are world famous for having one of the highest quality fleece of any breed of sheep. The short and fine fibers used in Merino yarn create a luxurious and soft texture that has all the resilience needed to create a long-lasting piece of knitwear.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Yarn Details\n                    Plus Icon\nMinus Icon\n\n\n\n\nFiber Content:                     34% Blue Faced Leicester, 33% Masham, 33% Merino\n                \nWeight: Aran/Heavy Worsted\n\nKnitting Gauge:                     4 - 4.75 sts = 1\" on #7 - 9 needles (4.5mm-5.5mm)\n                \nCrochet Gauge:                     11 -14 sc = 4'' on I - K hooks (5.5mm-6.5mm)\n                \nYards:                     168\n                \nGrams:                     100\n                \nPut Up:                     Hank\n                \nCare:                     Hand Wash / Dry Flat\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Care Instructions\n                    Plus Icon\nMinus Icon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

The wonderfully soft and touchable Merino is firmly twisted in a single strand, stable enough to discourage splitting and pilling, while still enjoying the finish and drape of single-ply construction—with special care taken to ensure even thickness. At approx. 8 wraps per inch, the yard-to-weight ratio can be deceiving, with extra weight from the dense twist knitting into a satisfying and substantial fabric. With machine washable convenience, you'll enjoy easy care hats, cowls, and accessories with next-to-skin softness, or sweaters and garments bursting with color.\n\nMeticulously hand-dyed by artisans, each skein of Muse is a study in the art of masterful color blending. The multi-colored hand-painted colorways are achieved by the blending of just 3 basic colors, applied with precision, which minimizes the streaking and pooling other hand-painted yarns are prone to. Functioning almost as solids, our tonal varieties are ideal for use in projects that feature textural stitches and cables, as the subtle variations in tone emphasize stitches and bring extra depth.\n\nPlease note: As a hand-painted yarn, colors may vary from skein to skein.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Yarn Details\n                    Plus Icon\nMinus Icon\n\n\n\n\nFiber Content:                     100% Superwash Merino Wool\n                \nWeight: Aran/Heavy Worsted\n\nKnitting Gauge:                     4 - 4.5 sts = 1\" on #7 -10 needles (4.5mm-5.5mm)\n                \nCrochet Gauge:                     11 - 14 sts sc = 4\"on I - K hooks\n                \nYards:                     114\n                \nGrams:                     100\n                \nPut Up:                     Hank\n                \nCare:                     Machine Wash Gentle Cold / Tumble Dry Low\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Care Instructions\n                    Plus Icon\nMinus Icon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

The wonderfully soft and touchable Merino is firmly twisted in a single strand, stable enough to discourage splitting and pilling, while still enjoying the finish and drape of single-ply construction—with special care taken to ensure even thickness. At approx. 8 wraps per inch, the yard-to-weight ratio can be deceiving, with extra weight from the dense twist knitting into a satisfying and substantial fabric. With machine washable convenience, you'll enjoy easy care hats, cowls, and accessories with next-to-skin softness, or sweaters and garments bursting with color.\n\nMeticulously hand-dyed by artisans, each skein of Muse is a study in the art of masterful color blending. The multi-colored hand-painted colorways are achieved by the blending of just 3 basic colors, applied with precision, which minimizes the streaking and pooling other hand-painted yarns are prone to. Functioning almost as solids, our tonal varieties are ideal for use in projects that feature textural stitches and cables, as the subtle variations in tone emphasize stitches and bring extra depth.\n\nPlease note: As a hand-painted yarn, colors may vary from skein to skein.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Yarn Details\n                    Plus Icon\nMinus Icon\n\n\n\n\nFiber Content:                     100% Superwash Merino Wool\n                \nWeight: Aran/Heavy Worsted\n\nKnitting Gauge:                     4 - 4.5 sts = 1\" on #7 -10 needles (4.5mm-5.5mm)\n                \nCrochet Gauge:                     11 - 14 sts sc = 4\"on I - K hooks\n                \nYards:                     114\n                \nGrams:                     100\n                \nPut Up:                     Hank\n                \nCare:                     Machine Wash Gentle Cold / Tumble Dry Low\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Care Instructions\n                    Plus Icon\nMinus Icon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

This tweed combines a classic heathered palette with earthy-colored flecks of Donegal tweed–viscose and acrylic neps that are spun alongside the Peruvian Highland wool. The tweedy Donegal neps add a rustic and traditional appeal to everything from cabled pullovers to outdoorsy hats and mitts. Wonderfully warm for all weather, this sturdy, all-purpose yarn has excellent stitch definition and heirloom durability.  As a worsted weight yarn, it’s a happy medium weight that’s commonly used for everything from garments to home goods, and Wool of the Andes’ heathered color palette with neutral-colored neps looks as cozy as your finished pieces will feel.\nUse Wool of the Andes Tweed Worsted to create bouncy cables, gorgeous textures, or beautiful colorwork. As a \"sticky\" wool–meaning the fibers grip lightly together–Wool of the Andes is an ideal choice for colorwork because stitches \"stick\" in place and won’t shift or loosen as you work, and the wide selection of saturated colors provides a wonderful palette for projects. 50g balls make it easy to add a wide variety of colors to your projects without waste, and for larger single-color projects, this sticky wool will splice together with ease when using the felted join. In addition to being great for projects where your stitches are on display, Wool of the Andes also felts beautifully with warm water and agitation, creating a dense, durable fabric with structure for felted slippers, bags, and beyond.\nWool of the Andes Tweed Worsted also comes in solids and heathers without neps as Wool of the Andes Worsted, and the two yarns can be mixed and matched to create an even wider selection of options for multicolor projects. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Yarn Details\n                    Plus Icon\nMinus Icon\n\n\n\n\nFiber Content:                     80% Peruvian Highland Wool, 20% Donegal Tweed\n                \nWeight: Worsted\n\nKnitting Gauge:                     4.5 - 5 sts = 1\" on #6 - 9 needles (4.0mm-5.5mm)\n                \nCrochet Gauge:                     11 - 14 sc = 4'' on I - K hooks (5.5 mm-6.5 mm)\n                \nYards:                     110\n                \nGrams:                     50\n                \nPut Up:                     Skein\n                \nCare:                     Hand Wash Cold / Lay Flat to Dry\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Care Instructions\n                    Plus Icon\nMinus Icon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Mix and match the larger balls with our beloved Animation Amigurumi Sets to create bigger and better adorable toys, amigurumi, decorations, and accessories. The same great colors are included in both formats and work perfectly when paired together, with individual balls providing the yardage for bigger creations and the sets providing small amounts of any accent colors you may need.\nAnimation is made with mercerized cotton, which means the cotton has been treated to have a smoother surface, allowing it to take in more dye and have a slight sheen while retaining strength. Although it's a DK-weight yarn and can be used at an average DK gauge for other projects, Animation really comes alive when you drop down 3-4 hook or needle sizes to create playful amigurumi.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Yarn Details\n                    Plus Icon\nMinus Icon\n\n\n\n\nFiber Content:                     100% Mercerized Cotton\n                \nWeight: DK\n\nKnitting Gauge:                     5 - 5.5 sts = 1\" on #5 - 7 needles (3.75mm-4.5mm)\n                \nCrochet Gauge:                     20 - 25 sc = 4'' on C - G hooks\n                \nYards:                     139\n                \nGrams:                     50\n                \nPut Up:                     Skein\n                \nCare:                     Machine Wash Gentle Cold / Tumble Dry Low\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Care Instructions\n                    Plus Icon\nMinus Icon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

The rich, solid colors show off texture, lace, and cables. The neutral neps of tweed add flecks of interest to simple stitches and textured knits but are subtle enough to accentuate rather than interfere with all but the most complex patterns. The understated neps also work well with striping, Fair Isle, and stranding, bringing a unifying element and additional texture to colorwork. With Merino softness and Donegal depth, this easy-care sock yarn is a terrifically tweedy treat for your feet.\n\nNote: For best machine wash results, turn your socks inside out and wash in cold water on a delicate cycle.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Yarn Details\n                    Plus Icon\nMinus Icon\n\n\n\n\nFiber Content:                     65% Fine Superwash Merino Wool, 25% Nylon, 10% Donegal Tweed (made of  70% Acrylic, 30% Viscose)\n                \nWeight: Fingering\n\nKnitting Gauge:                     7 - 8 sts = 1\" on #1 - 3 needles (2.25mm-3.25mm)\n                \nCrochet Gauge:                     21 - 23 sc = 4\"on B - E hooks\n                \nYards:                     231\n                \nGrams:                     50\n                \nPut Up:                     Skein\n                \nCare:                     Machine Wash Gentle Cold / Tumble Dry Low\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Care Instructions\n                    Plus Icon\nMinus Icon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

By selecting high-grade Merino wool (20.5 microns), we have been able to produce a machine-washable yarn that is super soft—definitely worthy of being worn against a baby's skin. Just the ticket for children's clothes, afghans, charity projects, and gifts. No need to worry about the care your hard work will receive since this yarn can be machine-washed and will come out even softer than before!\n\nSwish Worsted is a medium-weight yarn that will help you outfit the whole family in record time. Even those with sensitive skin will love the feel of baby-soft Merino, making this perfect for cuddly and warm sweaters and next-to-skin accessories like cowls and scarves. \nView the entire Swish family here.\nNote: For best machine wash results, turn the garment inside out (when possible), and wash separately in cold water on a delicate cycle. You may want to wash projects made from darker colors by themselves for the first few washes in case the yarn bleeds a bit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Yarn Details\n                    Plus Icon\nMinus Icon\n\n\n\n\nFiber Content:                     100% Fine Superwash Merino Wool\n                \nWeight: Worsted\n\nKnitting Gauge:                     4.5 - 5 sts = 1\" on #6 - 9 needles (4.0mm-5.5mm)\n                \nCrochet Gauge:                     11 - 14 sc = 4'' on I - K hooks (5.5 mm-6.5 mm)\n                \nYards:                     110\n                \nGrams:                     50\n                \nPut Up:                     Skein\n                \nCare:                     Machine Wash Gentle Cold / Tumble Dry Low\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Care Instructions\n                    Plus Icon\nMinus Icon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Our mills have collected waste fibers and sorted them by shade to be remixed, respun, and recycled into gorgeous limited edition heathers. Six beautiful neutrals and three sophisticated contrast colors come in DK weight, making this yarn a great choice for making toys, especially animal toys, as well as easy-care accessories, sweaters, blankets, and pillows. \nThis yarn is so soft that we were inspired to name it after our favorite snuggly critters! Each colorway shares its name with a pet owned by a Knit Picks or WeCrochet team member. To find out more about the pets they’re named after, read each color description!\nNote: Because these yarns are made with waste fiber, there may be a high level of variation between lots.

We chose neutral color Donegal tweed neps to incorporate into the 2-ply yarn. Donegal is a series of viscose neps (think slubs or bits of lint) that are suspended in a very fine acrylic mesh which allows them to be spun alongside the longer alpaca and Merino fibers. In the yarn, you won't be able to see the acrylic web at all, and the neps will appear either on the surface of the yarn or spun inside the yarn strand. The high ratio of neps gives City Tweed a traditional appeal. The use of Merino and alpaca makes it soft and warm. This weight is gorgeous in two-color knitting.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Yarn Details\n                    Plus Icon\nMinus Icon\n\n\n\n\nFiber Content:                     55% Merino Wool, 25% Superfine Alpaca, 20% Donegal Tweed\n                \nWeight: DK\n\nKnitting Gauge:                     5.5 sts = 1\" on #5 - 7 needles  (3.75mm-4.5mm)\n                \nCrochet Gauge:                     12 - 17 sc = 4'' on 7-I hooks\n                \nYards:                     123\n                \nGrams:                     50\n                \nPut Up:                     Ball\n                \nCare:                     Hand Wash Cold / Lay Flat to Dry\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Care Instructions\n                    Plus Icon\nMinus Icon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Chroma is our color-transitioning 70% superwash wool and 30% nylon blend yarn. Pair the brightest colors with your boldest projects, or choose a subdued shade for gentle waves of changing color. The colors move gently through a single ply, creating subtly blended and shaded sections. Chroma is a single-ply yarn that has differences in thickness that give a handspun look to your finished projects.\n\nYou can also purchase three solid colorways - Bare, Grey, and Black. They pair beautifully with the multicolor shades for great Faux Isle and striped projects.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Yarn Details\n                    Plus Icon\nMinus Icon\n\n\n\n\nFiber Content:                     70% Superwash Wool, 30% Nylon\n                \nWeight: Worsted\n\nKnitting Gauge:                     4.5 - 5 sts = 1\" on #6 - 9 needles  (4.0mm-5.5mm)\n                \nCrochet Gauge:                     11 - 14 sc = 4'' on I - K hooks (5.5 mm-6.5 mm)\n                \nYards:                     198\n                \nGrams:                     100\n                \nPut Up:                     Ball\n                \nCare:                     Machine Wash Gentle Cold / Tumble Dry Low\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Care Instructions\n                    Plus Icon\nMinus Icon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Chroma is our color-transitioning 70% superwash wool and 30% nylon blend yarn. Pair the brightest colors with your boldest projects, or choose a subdued shade for gentle waves of changing color. The colors move gently through a single ply, creating subtly blended and shaded sections. Chroma is a single-ply yarn that has differences in thickness that give a handspun look to your finished projects.\n\nYou can also purchase three solid colorways—Bare, Gray, and Black. They pair beautifully with the multicolor shades for great Faux Isle and striped projects.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Yarn Details\n                    Plus Icon\nMinus Icon\n\n\n\n\nFiber Content:                     70% Superwash Wool, 30% Nylon\n                \nWeight: Fingering\n\nKnitting Gauge:                     7 - 8 sts = 1\" on #1 - 3 needles (2.25mm-3.25mm)\n                \nCrochet Gauge:                     21 - 23 sc = 4'' on B - E hooks (2.25mm-3.5mm)\n                \nYards:                     396\n                \nGrams:                     100\n                \nPut Up:                     Ball\n                \nCare:                     Machine Wash Gentle Cold / Tumble Dry Low\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Care Instructions\n                    Plus Icon\nMinus Icon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Made from 100% Peruvian Highland wool, it’s a heavy-weight yarn that works up quickly into thick, cozy projects. Peruvian Highland wool is a strong fiber that has an excellent balance of structure, loft, and drape, and this sturdy, all-purpose yarn has excellent stitch definition and heirloom durability. As a bulky-weight yarn, it creates a cushy, irresistible, thick fabric that stitches up in a flash, making it perfect for last-minute gifts, speedy sweaters, and quick accessories. Wool of the Andes’ curated color palette is just as versatile as the yarn itself, with a mix of solids and heathers to choose from.\nUse Wool of the Andes to create bouncy cables, gorgeous textures, or beautiful colorwork. As a \"sticky\" wool–meaning the fibers grip lightly together–Wool of the Andes Bulky is a great choice for colorwork because stitches \"stick\" in place and won’t shift or loosen as you work, and the curated selection of saturated colors provides a wonderful palette for projects. In addition to being great for projects where your stitches are on display, Wool of the Andes also felts beautifully with warm water and agitation, creating a dense, durable fabric with structure for felted slippers, bags, and beyond.\nFor a convenient, machine-washable option, try Wool of the Andes Superwash Bulky.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Yarn Details\n                    Plus Icon\nMinus Icon\n\n\n\n\nFiber Content:                     100% Peruvian Highland Wool\n                \nWeight: Bulky\n\nKnitting Gauge:                     3 - 3.75 sts = 1\" on #10 - 11 needles (6.0mm-8.0mm)\n                \nCrochet Gauge:                     8 - 11 sc = 4'' on K-M hooks (6.5mm - 9mm)\n                \nYards:                     137\n                \nGrams:                     100\n                \nPut Up:                     Hank\n                \nCare:                     Hand Wash Cold / Lay Flat to Dry\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Care Instructions\n                    Plus Icon\nMinus Icon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

By selecting high-grade Merino wool (20.5 microns), we have been able to produce a machine-washable yarn that is super soft—definitely worthy of being worn against a baby's skin. Just the ticket for children's clothes, afghans, charity knitting, and gift knitting. No need to worry about the care your knitting will receive since this yarn can be machine-washed and will come out even softer than before!\nLightweight Swish DK is ideal for Fair Isle and other stranded colorwork, making warm and colorful hats, mittens, and pullovers. The extra soft merino is gentle enough for the most delicate skin, while convenience machine washability makes this the ideal yarn for pampering your wee ones.\nView the entire Swish family here.\nNote: For best machine wash results, turn the garment inside out (when possible), and wash separately in cold water on a delicate cycle. You may want to wash projects made from darker colors by themselves for the first few washes in case the yarn bleeds a bit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Yarn Details\n                    Plus Icon\nMinus Icon\n\n\n\n\nFiber Content:                     100% Fine Superwash Merino Wool\n                \nWeight: DK\n\nKnitting Gauge:                     5.5 sts = 1\" on #5 needles (3.75mm)\n                \nCrochet Gauge:                     12 - 17 sc = 4'' on 7-I hooks (4.5mm - 5.5mm)\n                \nYards:                     123\n                \nGrams:                     50\n                \nPut Up:                     Skein\n                \nCare:                     Machine Wash Gentle Cold / Tumble Dry Low\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Care Instructions\n                    Plus Icon\nMinus Icon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Spun from Peruvian wool, the strong fiber has an excellent balance of structure, loft, and drape that serves a wide variety of uses. Wonderfully warm for all weather, this sturdy, all-purpose yarn has excellent stitch definition and heirloom durability. It is ideal for cabled sweaters, textured stitch afghans, and everyday accessories.\n\nWool of the Andes Superwash is the same worsted weight Peruvian wool, specially treated to prevent felting so you can enjoy all the warmth, structure, and durability of wool with the convenience of machine washing. Usable for all the same things as regular Wool of the Andes, the superwash version is particularly excellent for projects that are heavily used or difficult to hand wash, such as gloves, blankets, and children's clothes.\nView other weights and Bare versions of Wool of the Andes here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Yarn Details\n                    Plus Icon\nMinus Icon\n\n\n\n\nFiber Content:                     100% Superwash Wool\n                \nWeight: Worsted\n\nKnitting Gauge:                     4.5 - 5 sts = 1\" on #6 - 9 needles (4.0mm - 5.5mm)\n                \nCrochet Gauge:                     11 - 14 sc = 4\" on I - K hooks\n                \nYards:                     110\n                \nGrams:                     50\n                \nPut Up:                     Skein\n                \nCare:                     Machine Wash Gentle Cold / Tumble Dry Low\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Care Instructions\n                    Plus Icon\nMinus Icon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Tanguis (tan-gwiss) cotton has a very soft hand, excellent absorption, and, because it is a naturally white fiber, a high affinity for dyes. The Belgian linen adds characteristic flecks and additional absorbency with very low elasticity, helping to alleviate stretching in the finished project. Summer linen has an extended growing period which results in a longer, stronger fiber. When blended with the already strong Tanguis cotton, it makes a durable, wearable, and soft yarn. The crocheted fabric will get softer with each wash, too.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Yarn Details\n                    Plus Icon\nMinus Icon\n\n\n\n\nFiber Content:                     70% Tanguis Cotton / 30% Linen\n                \nWeight: DK\n\nKnitting Gauge:                     5.5 sts = 1 on #5-7 needles (3.75mm-4.5mm)\n                \nCrochet Gauge:                     12 - 17 sc = 4'' on 7-I hooks (4.5mm-5.5mm)\n                \nYards:                     123\n                \nGrams:                     50\n                \nPut Up:                     Skein\n                \nCare:                     Machine Wash Gentle Cold / Tumble Dry Low\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Care Instructions\n                    Plus Icon\nMinus Icon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Peruvian Highland wool is a strong fiber that has an excellent balance of structure, loft, and drape, and Wool of the Andes Sport is our finest-gauge yarn available in the Wool of the Andes family. Wool of the Andes’ extensive color palette is just as versatile as the yarn itself, with dozens of solids and heathers to choose from.\nUse Wool of the Andes to create bouncy cables, gorgeous textures, or beautiful colorwork. As a \"sticky\" wool–meaning the fibers grip lightly together–Wool of the Andes Sport is an ideal choice for both stranded colorwork and intarsia because stitches \"stick\" in place and won’t shift or loosen as you work, and the wide selection of saturated colors provides a wonderful palette for projects. 50g balls make it easy to add a wide variety of colors to your projects without waste, and for larger single-color projects, this sticky wool will splice together with ease when using the felted join. In addition to being great for projects where your stitches are on display, Wool of the Andes also felts beautifully with warm water and agitation, creating a dense, durable fabric with structure for felted slippers, bags, and beyond. \nView other weights and Bare versions of Wool of the Andes here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Yarn Details\n                    Plus Icon\nMinus Icon\n\n\n\n\nFiber Content:                     100% Peruvian Highland Wool\n                \nWeight: Sport\n\nKnitting Gauge:                     6 sts = 1\" on #3 - 5 needles (3.25mm-3.75mm)\n                \nCrochet Gauge:                     16 - 20 sc = 4'' on E-7 hooks\n                \nYards:                     137\n                \nGrams:                     50\n                \nPut Up:                     Skein\n                \nCare:                     Hand Wash Cold / Lay Flat to Dry\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Care Instructions\n                    Plus Icon\nMinus Icon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Wonderfluff works with a wide range of hook sizes and with 142 yards per 50g, the generous yardage allows for large, luxurious projects that won't break the bank.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Yarn Details\n                    Plus Icon\nMinus Icon\n\n\n\n\nFiber Content:                     70% Baby Alpaca, 7% Merino Wool, 23% Nylon\n                \nWeight: Bulky\n\nKnitting Gauge:                     3 - 3.75 sts = 1\" on #10 - 11 needles (6.0mm-8.0mm)\n                \nCrochet Gauge:                     8 - 11 sc = 4'' on K - M hooks (6.5mm - 9mm)\n                \nYards:                     142\n                \nGrams:                     50\n                \nPut Up:                     Ball\n                \nCare:                     Hand Wash Cold / Lay Flat to Dry\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Care Instructions\n                    Plus Icon\nMinus Icon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

With beautiful sheen, saturated colors, and crisp stitch definition, Vividie is the perfect yarn for summer tops, transitional sweaters, and light accessories. The sophisticated color palette was chosen with handmade wardrobes in mind, featuring gorgeous neutrals, deep jewel tones, and a few pops of bright color. We know you’ll want to wear pieces made with this breathable, soft yarn every day!\nVividie is made with 100% mercerized cotton. The mercerization process smoothes the outer layer of the cotton fibers, which creates an incredible sheen and also allows the mercerized cotton to absorb more dye and shed less lint. The one drawback to mercerized cotton is that it’s less absorbent than regular cotton, so we don’t recommend using Vividie for washcloths. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Yarn Details\n                    Plus Icon\nMinus Icon\n\n\n\n\nFiber Content:                     100% Mercerized Cotton\n                \nWeight: Worsted\n\nKnitting Gauge:                     4.5 sts = 1\" on #7 - 8 needles (4.5mm-5.0mm)\n                \nCrochet Gauge:                     11 - 14 sc = 4'' on I - K hooks (5.5 mm-6.5 mm)\n                \nYards:                     190\n                \nGrams:                     100\n                \nPut Up:                     Skein\n                \nCare:                     Machine Wash Gentle Cold / Tumble Dry Low\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Care Instructions\n                    Plus Icon\nMinus Icon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Together they make a beautiful canvas for colors that range from bright and playful to moody and sophisticated. A classic high twist gives this the bounce and resilience, great for the projects Hawthorne does best: unique socks, stunning shawls, and soft yet durable accessories. It even makes beautiful garments, like sweaters and shells, where its hand-crafted colors can get the attention they deserve.\n\nHawthorne comes in four dye styles, each as beautiful as the next, and they mix and match beautifully for projects that use multiple colors.\n\nKettle Dyed – Skeins of Hawthorne Kettle Dyed are fully submerged in a large vessel, and then dye is added with minimal agitation to create beautiful semi-solid shades.\nMulti – Hawthorne Multi is hand-painted to intentionally create surprising pops of color and variegation. \nTonal – To create the complex tonal colors of Hawthorne Tonal, dyes in multiple shades are hand-painted on each skein. \nSpeckle – Another hand-painted yarn, Hawthorne Speckle had dye speckled over each hank to create fun sprinkles of color. \n\nPlease note that due to the dye methods used, colors may vary from skein to skein.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Yarn Details\n                    Plus Icon\nMinus Icon\n\n\n\n\nFiber Content:                     80% Fine Superwash Highland Wool, 20% Polyamide (Nylon)\n                \nWeight: Fingering\n\nKnitting Gauge:                     7 - 8 sts = 1\" on #1 - 3 needles (2.25mm-3.25mm)\n                \nCrochet Gauge:                     21 - 23 sc = 4'' on B - E hooks (2.25mm-3.5mm)\n                \nYards:                     357\n                \nGrams:                     100\n                \nPut Up:                     Hank\n                \nCare:                     Machine Wash Gentle Cold / Tumble Dry Low\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Care Instructions\n                    Plus Icon\nMinus Icon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Alla Prima (formerly known as Array Super Bulky) is a chunky single-ply yarn made up of 100% Merino and beautiful, vivid colors.\nThe hand-painted colorways are the highlight of Alla Prima, which is named after a classic painting technique. Some hand-painted shades feature a wash of color on the cream base to coordinate with the hand-painted colors and other shades let the natural wool act as a neutral base for the vivid colors.  Hand-painted Alla Prima comes in hanks like it was dyed, and each hank is its own work of art.\nAlla Prima also comes in coordinating solids, dyed with the same colors used for the multicolor hand-painted skeins. Incredibly soft and richly colored, it’s a yarn you’ll want to cuddle up with, making it a great choice for quick, dramatic cowls, scarves, and hats. Solid Alla Prima is conveniently put up in donut balls that require no rewinding.\nNote: Due to the heavy saturation of the hand-painted colors, some bleeding may occur when washing. As a hand-painted yarn, colors may vary from skein to skein\nLooking for a bare undyed version of Alla Prima?

Each of this yarn's three plies are individually dyed with the same classic Chroma colorway before being spun together. The result is a sturdy yet soft yarn with a thick-and-thin strand that mimics beautiful handspun yarn; no two hanks will ever be the same! Though Chroma Twist Bulky can be crocheted at a variety of gauges and densities, we recommend it for bulky-weight projects stitched at a more open gauge so that the soft fibers can bloom with blocking.\n\nChroma Twist Bulky is perfect for quick projects that need a twist of color: hats and scarves, kid's garments, home decor, and more! And because this yarn is a blend of superwash wool and nylon, your projects will be machine washable too!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Yarn Details\n                    Plus Icon\nMinus Icon\n\n\n\n\nFiber Content:                     70% Superwash Wool / 30% Nylon\n                \nWeight: Bulky\n\nKnitting Gauge:                     3-3.75 sts = 1\" on #10-11 needles (6.0mm- 8.0mm)\n                \nCrochet Gauge:                     8-11 sc = 4'' on K-M hooks\n                \nYards:                     127\n                \nGrams:                     100\n                \nPut Up:                     Hank\n                \nCare:                     Machine Wash Gentle Cold / Tumble Dry Low\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Care Instructions\n                    Plus Icon\nMinus Icon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

We chose neutral color Donegal tweed neps to incorporate into the 2-ply yarn. Donegal is a series of viscose neps (think slubs or bits of lint) that are suspended in a very fine acrylic mesh which allows them to be spun alongside the longer alpaca and Merino fibers. In the yarn, you won't be able to see the acrylic web at all, and the neps will appear either on the surface of the yarn or spun inside the yarn strand. The high ratio of neps gives City Tweed a traditional appeal. The use of Merino and alpaca makes it soft and warm.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Yarn Details\n                    Plus Icon\nMinus Icon\n\n\n\n\nFiber Content:                     55% Merino Wool, 25% Superfine Alpaca, 20% Donegal Tweed\n                \nWeight: Aran/Heavy Worsted\n\nKnitting Gauge:                     4 - 4.75 sts = 1\" on #7 - 9 needles (4.5mm-5.5mm)\n                \nCrochet Gauge:                     11 - 14 sc = 4'' on I - K hooks (5.5 mm-6.5 mm)\n                \nYards:                     164\n                \nGrams:                     100\n                \nPut Up:                     Ball\n                \nCare:                     Hand Wash Cold / Lay Flat to Dry\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Care Instructions\n                    Plus Icon\nMinus Icon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

That's the case with Whoopsland, our first attempt at creating a tweed-free version of our beloved Woodland yarn. This luxurious blend of 80% merino and 20% alpaca strikes the perfect balance between rustic charm and refined elegance. With just enough alpaca to add warmth and softness, this Merino-based yarn is ideal for winter wear and gentle enough for next-to-skin projects. Its loose, gentle twist provides excellent thermal efficiency, drape, and stitch definition.\n\nDuring production, we found that this tweed-free version had slightly more pilling than expected post-dyeing. Rather than letting it go to waste, we’re offering it at a special discounted price, letting you enjoy premium yarn at an exceptional value.\n\nDespite the minor pilling, the high Merino content ensures superb stitch definition, making it perfect for textured or cabled designs, whether you're aiming for a cottage-core vibe or a more classic style. This limited-edition yarn is soft enough for accessories and versatile enough for a variety of projects. Don’t miss your chance to experience Whoopsland—a premium yarn with a bit of added character, available at a budget-friendly price.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Yarn Details\n                    Plus Icon\nMinus Icon\n\n\n\n\nFiber Content:                     80% Merino Wool, 20% Baby Alpaca\n                \nWeight: Aran/Heavy Worsted\n\nKnitting Gauge:                     4 - 4.75 sts = 1\" on #7 - 9 needles (4.5mm-5.5mm)\n                \nCrochet Gauge:                     11-14 sc = 4'' on I - K hooks (5.5 mm-6.5 mm)\n                \nYards:                     180\n                \nGrams:                     100\n                \nPut Up:                     Hank\n                \nCare:                     Hand Wash Cold / Lay Flat to Dry\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Care Instructions\n                    Plus Icon\nMinus Icon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

The Fine Highland fiber has a soft hand with plenty of drape, but retains the solid structure of wool, making this perfect for cabling. Each colorway is created by spinning together a lighter and darker tone of the same color, which knits up into a surprisingly uniform fabric with wonderful depth of color. Neutral Donegal neps bring a distinct visual texture. Donegal is a series of viscose neps (think slubs or bits of lint) that are suspended in a very fine acrylic mesh which allows them to be spun alongside the longer wool. With such rich colors and that signature look of tweed, you have a vibrant and rustic yarn with plenty of charm.\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Yarn Details\n                    Plus Icon\nMinus Icon\n\n\n\n\nFiber Content:                     80% Fine Superwash Highland Wool, 20% Donegal Tweed (made of 70% acrylic, 30% viscose)\n                \nWeight: Worsted\n\nKnitting Gauge:                     4.5 - 5 sts = 1\" on #6 - 9 needles (4.0mm-5.5mm)\n                \nCrochet Gauge:                     11 - 14 sc = 4'' on I - K hooks (5.5 mm-6.5 mm)\n                \nYards:                     273\n                \nGrams:                     100\n                \nPut Up:                     Hank\n                \nCare:                     Machine Wash Gentle Cold / Tumble Dry Low\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Care Instructions\n                    Plus Icon\nMinus Icon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Animation mini skein packs are the perfect yarn for toys, amigurumi, and other adorable little creations. The color-coordinated mini skeins are so cute that you'll be tempted to display them whole! Mercerized cotton gives a unique sheen and deep color saturation, and when you crochet it at a dense gauge, 3D elements keep their shape without fuss!\n\nAlthough it's a DK-weight yarn and can be used at an average DK gauge for other projects, Animation really comes alive when you drop down 3-4 hook sizes to create playful amigurumi.\n\nEach Animation pack includes 10 color-coordinated mini skeins (each mini skein equaling 69.8 yards / 25 grams). Exactly what you'll need to make an adorable collection of tiny creations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Yarn Details\n                    Plus Icon\nMinus Icon\n\n\n\n\nFiber Content:                     100% Mercerized Cotton\n                \nWeight: DK\n\nKnitting Gauge:                     5 - 5.5 sts = 1\" on #5 - 7 needles (3.75mm - 4.5mm)\n                \nCrochet Gauge:                     20 - 25 sc = 4'' on C - G Hooks (2.75mm - 4.0mm)\n                \nYards:                     698\n                \nGrams:                     250\n                \nPut Up:                     Pack\n                \nCare:                     Machine Wash Gentle Cold / Tumble Dry Low\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Care Instructions\n                    Plus Icon\nMinus Icon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Made of Peruvian baby alpaca, Andean Treasure both looks and feels luxurious with beautiful drape and hand feel. When producing alpaca yarns, alpaca fibers are sorted by their diameter (micron count), and the finest fibers are the softest. Baby alpaca is one of the softest and finest classifications of alpaca, and it's also a delightfully warm, and cozy fiber, holding in heat better than sheep’s wool. Andean Treasure is a decadent choice for next-to-skin winter accessories like scarves, cowls, hats, and headbands, and it looks particularly nice in lacy stitch patterns. For some quiet luxury, try Andean Treasure for felting projects, like felted slippers.\n \nLooking for Bare, undyed Andean Treasure DK? Find it here!\n\nWe’ve reclassified Andean Treasure as a DK weight yarn based on customer feedback, but this is the same Andean Treasure you know and love, with the same yardage and grams per ball. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Yarn Details\n                    Plus Icon\nMinus Icon\n\n\n\n\nFiber Content:                     100% Baby Alpaca\n                \nWeight: DK\n\nKnitting Gauge:                     6 sts = 1\" on #3 - 5 needles (3.25mm-3.75mm)\n                \nCrochet Gauge:                     16 - 20 sc = 4'' on E-4 - 7 hooks (3.5mm - 4.5mm)\n                \nYards:                     110\n                \nGrams:                     50\n                \nPut Up:                     Ball\n                \nCare:                     Hand Wash Cold / Lay Flat to Dry\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Care Instructions\n                    Plus Icon\nMinus Icon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

By selecting high-grade Merino wool (20.5 microns), we have been able to produce a machine-washable yarn that is super soft—definitely worthy of being worn against a baby's skin. Just the ticket for children's clothes, afghans, charity projects, and gifts. No need to worry about the care your hard work will receive since this yarn can be machine-washed and will come out even softer than before!\n\nSwish Bulky is a heavy-weight yarn so soft and lofty that \"bulky\" seems like a misnomer. Large enough to give the squishy extra fine merino room to fully breathe and bloom, this yarn crochets up in no time into the softest, springiest accessories and garments. For quick hats that you'll want against your forehead and cowls that are as convenient as they feel decadent, Swish Bulky will have you swooning.\nView the entire Swish family here.\nNote: For best machine wash results, turn the garment inside out (when possible), and wash separately in cold water on a delicate cycle. You may want to wash projects made from darker colors by themselves for the first few washes in case the yarn bleeds a bit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Yarn Details\n                    Plus Icon\nMinus Icon\n\n\n\n\nFiber Content:                     100% Fine Superwash Merino Wool\n                \nWeight: Bulky\n\nKnitting Gauge:                     3 - 3.75 sts = 1\" on #10 - 11 needles (6.0mm-8.0mm)\n                \nCrochet Gauge:                     8 - 11 sc = 4'' on K - M hooks (6.5mm - 9mm)\n                \nYards:                     137\n                \nGrams:                     100\n                \nPut Up:                     Hank\n                \nCare:                     Machine Wash Gentle Cold / Tumble Dry Low\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Care Instructions\n                    Plus Icon\nMinus Icon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

With just enough alpaca to take best advantage of that downy fiber’s warmth and softness, this largely Merino yarn is warm enough for woodland winters and soft enough to wear against the skin. Gently spun into a loose twist, the downy fibers are given enough play to provide both thermal efficiency and flattering drape, while still maintaining the structure necessary for excellent stitch definition and durability.\n\nLightly tweedy, neutrally-colored viscose neps are just present enough to create a subtly rustic look in every colorway. Because of its high Merino content, Woodland Tweed makes bouncy cables and textured stitch patterns that pop, and paired with its woodsy color palette, it’s a great choice for cabled pullovers and gansey sweaters, whether your taste is cottagecore or classic! As well as being perfect for warm sweaters and garments of all sorts, this versatile yarn is also soft enough for accessories worn against the skin.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Yarn Details\n                    Plus Icon\nMinus Icon\n\n\n\n\nFiber Content:                     80% Merino, 15% Baby Alpaca, 5% Viscose\n                \nWeight: Aran/Heavy Worsted\n\nKnitting Gauge:                     4 - 4.75 sts = 1\" on #7 - 9 needles (4.5mm-5.5mm)\n                \nCrochet Gauge:                     11-14 sc = 4'' on I - K hooks (5.5 mm-6.5 mm)\n                \nYards:                     180\n                \nGrams:                     100\n                \nPut Up:                     Hank\n                \nCare:                     Hand Wash Cold / Lay Flat to Dry\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Care Instructions\n                    Plus Icon\nMinus Icon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

With a blend of soft, superfine alpaca and polyester SEAQUAL ® YARN made from Upcycled Marine Plastic, this yarn feels decadent and will warm both your body and heart. Oceana features a chainette construction with the alpaca loosely incorporated to trap more air and make a warm, light, fluffy yarn. The polyester and alpaca are dyed contrasting colors before plying, which helps emphasize the alpaca halo and adds dimension. With its bright colors, Oceana is ideal for warm accessories and sweaters that make a big statement!\nThis yarn was created with SEAQUAL INITIATIVE. SEAQUAL INITIATIVE works with NGOs, fishermen, authorities, and local communities to help clean our oceans. Marine litter from our beaches, ocean floor & surface, rivers & estuaries, is collected by clean-up programs. It is then sorted into different material types and the plastic portion is cleaned and transformed into Upcycled Marine Plastic. Environmentally conscious brands and manufacturers then transform this new, fully-traceable raw material into inspiring sustainable products for every aspect of our lives. Consumer purchasing power is one of the most powerful tools for change. In choosing products containing Upcycled Marine Plastic, you are helping to clean our oceans. \nLearn more about SEAQUAL INITIATIVE.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Yarn Details\n                    Plus Icon\nMinus Icon\n\n\n\n\nFiber Content:                     54% Superfine Alpaca, 46% Polyester SEAQUAL®\n                \nWeight: Worsted\n\nKnitting Gauge:                     3.5 - 4.5 sts = 1\" on #6 - 9 needles (4.0mm-5.5mm)\n                \nCrochet Gauge:                     13 - 17 sc = 4'' on I - K hooks (5.5 mm-6.5 mm)\n                \nYards:                     136\n                \nGrams:                     50\n                \nPut Up:                     Ball\n                \nCare:                     Hand Wash Cold / Lay Flat to Dry\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Care Instructions\n                    Plus Icon\nMinus Icon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

The natural warmth of alpaca fiber creates a wonderful yarn for luxuriously cozy garments and accessories that stitch up in a trice.\n\nWhile Simply Alpaca's loose ply gives finished projects excellent drape, it also means this yarn can be worked on a variety of hook sizes to achieve different fabric densities. It's possible to use this yarn in worsted weight projects, however, we recommend a larger Aran/HW gauge for an open, airy finished fabric. A larger gauge allows these beautiful fibers to bloom after blocking resulting in an even more luxurious project.\n\nNo dyes or bleach are used to process the yarn; a full spectrum of natural shades is created by meticulously sorting the fiber. As colors are naturally occurring, some variation from skein to skein is normal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Yarn Details\n                    Plus Icon\nMinus Icon\n\n\n\n\nFiber Content:                     100% Superfine Alpaca\n                \nWeight: Aran/Heavy Worsted\n\nKnitting Gauge:                     4 - 4.75 sts = 1\" on #7 - 9 needles (4.5mm-5.5mm)\n                \nCrochet Gauge:                     11 - 14 sc = 4'' on I - K hooks (5.5 mm-6.5 mm)\n                \nYards:                     246\n                \nGrams:                     100\n                \nPut Up:                     Hank\n                \nCare:                     Hand Wash Cold / Lay Flat to Dry\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Care Instructions\n                    Plus Icon\nMinus Icon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

A reflection of the great Northwest, Hawthorne is a yarn inspired by the varied and vibrant place we call home. This sturdy, colorful, superwash yarn is made up of a blend of superwash wool for comfort and warmth and nylon for strength. Together they make a beautiful canvas for colors that range from bright and playful to moody and sophisticated. A classic high twist gives this the bounce and resilience, great for projects that are both sturdy and make a statement. Use this DK-weight version of Hawthorne for heavy socks and slippers, midweight accessories, easy-care blankets, and gorgeous sweaters.\nHawthorne DK features the best of Hawthorne Fingering colors and comes in four dye styles, each as beautiful as the next. Mix and match dye styles to create stunning multicolor projects.\nKettle Dyed – Skeins of Hawthorne Kettle Dyed are fully submerged in a large vessel, and then dye is added with minimal agitation to create beautiful semi-solid shades.\nMulti – Hawthorne Multi is hand-painted to intentionally create surprising pops of color and variegation. \nTonal – To create the complex tonal colors of Hawthorne Tonal, dyes in multiple shades are hand-painted on each skein. \nSpeckle – Another hand-painted yarn, Hawthorne Speckle had dye speckled over each hank to create fun sprinkles of color.\nPlease note that due to the dye methods used, colors may vary from skein to skein.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Yarn Details\n                    Plus Icon\nMinus Icon\n\n\n\n\nFiber Content:                     80% Fine Superwash Highland Wool, 20% Polyamide (Nylon)\n                \nWeight: DK\n\nKnitting Gauge:                     5.5 sts=1\" on #5 - 6 needles (3.75mm - 4.0mm)\n                \nCrochet Gauge:                     12 - 17 sc = 4'' on 7-I hooks (4.5mm - 5.5mm)\n                \nYards:                     225\n                \nGrams:                     100\n                \nPut Up:                     Hank\n                \nCare:                     Machine Wash Gentle Cold / Tumble Dry Low\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Care Instructions\n                    Plus Icon\nMinus Icon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

The wonderfully soft and touchable Merino is firmly twisted in a single strand, stable enough to discourage splitting and pilling, while still enjoying the finish and drape of single-ply construction—with special care taken to ensure even thickness. At approx. 8 wraps per inch, the yard-to-weight ratio can be deceiving, with extra weight from the dense twist knitting into a satisfying and substantial fabric. With machine washable convenience, you'll enjoy easy care hats, cowls, and accessories with next-to-skin softness, or sweaters and garments bursting with color.\n\nMeticulously hand-dyed by artisans, each skein of Muse is a study in the art of masterful color blending. The multi-colored hand-painted colorways are achieved by the blending of just 3 basic colors, applied with precision, which minimizes the streaking and pooling other hand-painted yarns are prone to. Functioning almost as solids, our tonal varieties are ideal for use in projects that feature textural stitches and cables, as the subtle variations in tone emphasize stitches and bring extra depth.\n\nPlease note: As a hand-painted yarn, colors may vary from skein to skein.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Yarn Details\n                    Plus Icon\nMinus Icon\n\n\n\n\nFiber Content:                     100% Superwash Merino Wool\n                \nWeight: Aran/Heavy Worsted\n\nKnitting Gauge:                     4 - 4.5 sts = 1\" on #7 -10 needles (4.5mm-5.5mm)\n                \nCrochet Gauge:                     11 - 14 sts sc = 4\"on I - K hooks\n                \nYards:                     114\n                \nGrams:                     100\n                \nPut Up:                     Hank\n                \nCare:                     Machine Wash Gentle Cold / Tumble Dry Low\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Care Instructions\n                    Plus Icon\nMinus Icon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

High Desert features jewel-toned solids and rustic heathers inspired by the Oregon high desert landscape and skyline, and beyond the inspiration for its colors, High Desert is made with 100% American-grown wool from the Shaniko Wool Company in Oregon. The irresistibly soft wool is processed in South Carolina and dyed and milled in North Carolina. \n \nHigh Desert Sport is a great choice for lighter garments and accessories. Its tight twist provides beautiful stitch definition, and it makes wonderfully bouncy cables and textured stitches. The 100% American wool is a luxurious blend of Merino and Merino-Rambouillet, incredibly soft fibers that are perfect for pieces worn next to the skin.\n \nHigh Desert Sport comes in 100g hanks, and accent colors are also available in 50g hanks for smaller projects and colorwork. \n \nNote: Select colors of 100g High Desert Sport come in pull skeins as the full line transitions to hanks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Yarn Details\n                    Plus Icon\nMinus Icon\n\n\n\n\nFiber Content:                     100% American Wool\n                \nWeight: Sport\n\nKnitting Gauge:                     6 sts = 1\" on #3 - 5 needles (3.25mm-3.75mm)\n                \nCrochet Gauge:                     16 - 20 sc = 4'' on E-7 hooks\n                \nYards:                     298\n                \nGrams:                     100\n                \nPut Up:                     Hank\n                \nCare:                     Hand Wash Cold / Lay Flat to Dry\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Care Instructions\n                    Plus Icon\nMinus Icon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Snuggle Puff is a heavy worsted or Aran weight cotton yarn made possible by new innovations in yarn construction, allowing fiber from our favorite plant to be blown into a nylon mesh. Without the rigid structure of spinning and plying, the resulting yarn is amazingly lightweight and lofty, keeping more of Pima Cotton's superlative drape and huggable softness than traditional yarn construction. With the added benefit of natural machine washable convenience, Snuggle Puff is perfect for wool-free accessories and more for babies, children, anyone with extra sensitive skin, and cotton fans of all kinds.\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Yarn Details\n                    Plus Icon\nMinus Icon\n\n\n\n\nFiber Content:                     70% Pima Cotton, 30% Nylon\n                \nWeight: Aran/Heavy Worsted\n\nKnitting Gauge:                     3 - 3.75 sts = 1\" on #10 - 11 needles (6mm-8mm)\n                \nCrochet Gauge:                     8 - 11 sc = 4'' on K - M hooks\n                \nYards:                     142\n                \nGrams:                     50\n                \nPut Up:                     Ball\n                \nCare:                     Machine Wash Gentle Cold / Tumble Dry Low\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Care Instructions\n                    Plus Icon\nMinus Icon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

High Desert features jewel-toned solids and rustic heathers inspired by the Oregon high desert landscape and skyline, and beyond the inspiration for its colors, High Desert is made with 100% American-grown wool from the Shaniko Wool Company in Oregon. The irresistibly soft wool is processed in South Carolina and dyed and milled in North Carolina. \n \nHigh Desert Worsted is a great choice for cozy garments and accessories. Its tight twist provides beautiful stitch definition, and it makes wonderfully bouncy cables and textured stitches. The 100% American wool is a luxurious blend of Merino and Merino-Rambouillet, incredibly soft fibers that are perfect for pieces worn next to the skin.\n \nHigh Desert Worsted comes in 100g hanks, and accent colors are also available in 50g hanks for smaller projects and colorwork. \n \nNote: Select colors of 100g High Desert Worsted come in pull skeins as the full line transitions to hanks. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Yarn Details\n                    Plus Icon\nMinus Icon\n\n\n\n\nFiber Content:                     100% American Wool\n                \nWeight: Worsted\n\nKnitting Gauge:                     4.5 - 5 sts = 1\" on #6 - 9 needles (4.0mm-5.5mm)\n                \nCrochet Gauge:                     11 - 14 sc = 4'' on I - K hooks (5.5 mm-6.5 mm)\n                \nYards:                     217\n                \nGrams:                     100\n                \nPut Up:                     Skein\n                \nCare:                     Hand Wash Cold / Lay Flat to Dry\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Care Instructions\n                    Plus Icon\nMinus Icon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

It's the soft, satiny choice for indulgent washcloths, children's clothes, or modular makes that allow the variegated splashes of color to stand out. Work with one skein at a time to enjoy the natural pooling of the variegated colors, or alternate skeins to create dashes of color.\n\nWorsted weight Shine acts as the background for our bright pops of color. Durable Modal adds strength and sheen to extra-soft Pima Cotton, minimizing pilling and stretching. Dishcloths will stay in good shape for ages, and garments won't sag and lose their shape. Plus, it's machine washable, making it as easy to care for as it is to craft with.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Yarn Details\n                    Plus Icon\nMinus Icon\n\n\n\n\nFiber Content:                     60% Pima Cotton, 40% Modal\n                \nWeight: Worsted\n\nKnitting Gauge:                     4.5 - 5 sts = 1\" on #6 - 9 needles (4.0mm-5.5mm)\n                \nCrochet Gauge:                     11 - 14 sc = 4'' on I - K hooks (5.5 mm-6.5 mm)\n                \nYards:                     150\n                \nGrams:                     100\n                \nPut Up:                     Hank\n                \nCare:                     Machine Wash Gentle Cold / Tumble Dry Low\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Care Instructions\n                    Plus Icon\nMinus Icon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

The product of centuries of shepherding tradition, the balanced twist and dense, plump hand give this yarn fabulous definition for textured or cabled sweaters and accessories. No dyes or bleach are used to process the yarn; the eight natural shades are created by meticulously sorting the fiber as it comes off the sheep. As colors are naturally occurring, some variation from skein to skein is normal.\n\n3/2022 update: Please note, initially this yarn was listed as a Bulky weight; after many tests and customer feedback, we have determined it produces an Aran/Heavy Worsted fabric using the needle size and gauge information provided.

Rich colors and eye-capturing neutrals were inspired by the Oregon high desert environment, and the flecks of tweed are reminiscent of the landscape dotted with sheep. Beyond the inspiration for its colors, High Desert is made with American-grown wool from the Shaniko Wool Company in Oregon. The irresistibly soft fibers are processed in South Carolina and dyed and milled in North Carolina to become this worsted-weight yarn.\n\nHigh Desert Tweed is a great choice for cozy garments and accessories. Its tight twist provides beautiful stitch definition, and it makes wonderfully bouncy cables and textured stitches. The amount of tweed neps strikes the right balance to add interest without competing with complex stitch patterns, and the American wool is a luxurious blend of Merino and Merino-Rambouillet, incredibly soft fibers that are perfect for pieces worn next to the skin.\n\nHigh Desert Tweed can be paired with High Desert Worsted for even more color options.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Yarn Details\n                    Plus Icon\nMinus Icon\n\n\n\n\nFiber Content:                     89% American Wool, 6% Acrylic, 5% Rayon\n                \nWeight: Worsted\n\nKnitting Gauge:                     4.5 - 5 sts = 1\" on #6 - 9 needles (4.0mm-5.5mm)\n                \nCrochet Gauge:                     11 - 14 sc = 4'' on I - K hooks (5.5 mm-6.5 mm)\n                \nYards:                     210\n                \nGrams:                     100\n                \nPut Up:                     Hank\n                \nCare:                     Hand Wash Cold / Lay Flat to Dry\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Care Instructions\n                    Plus Icon\nMinus Icon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Delicate loops of Merino and alpaca are spun around a nylon and Merino core to create a decadently light, textured yarn that’s irresistible to touch. The fluffy loops will obscure delicate lace and intricate stitches, but what is lost in stitch definition is gained in coziness. Crocheted at a denser gauge, Bubbly Bouclé creates an opaque, textured fabric, and at a looser gauge, it’s ever-so-slightly sheer with more prominent loops. With generous yardage and a lofty construction, you’ll be amazed at how little yarn is needed to create airy yet cozy projects that weigh next to nothing.\nBubbly Bouclé comes in a selection of sophisticated neutrals and vivid brights that are naturally lightly heathered due to the fiber blend absorbing color in different amounts. The range of shades is perfect for everything from garments to toys. Use Bubbly Bouclé’s brighter colors for textured fashion pieces and vintage-inspired sweaters, or choose the neutrals for a faux-fur look or to add fluffy accents to adorable figurines like gnomes, teddy bears, and sheep. \nAlso available in an undyed, Bare version here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Yarn Details\n                    Plus Icon\nMinus Icon\n\n\n\n\nFiber Content:                     82% Superfine Alpaca, 13% Merino Wool, 5% Nylon\n                \nWeight: Sport\n\nKnitting Gauge:                     4.25 – 5.5 sts=1\" on #4 - 7 needles (3.25 mm-4.5mm)\n                \nCrochet Gauge:                     22 - 24 sc = 4'' on E - G hooks\n                \nYards:                     328\n                \nGrams:                     100\n                \nPut Up:                     Hank\n                \nCare:                     Hand Wash Cold / Lay Flat to Dry\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Care Instructions\n                    Plus Icon\nMinus Icon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Each yarn ply is individually dyed with the same classic Chroma colorway before being spun together. The result is a sturdy yet soft yarn with a thick-and-thin strand that mimics beautiful handspun yarn; no two hanks will ever be the same! Though Chroma Twist Worsted can be crocheted at a variety of gauges and densities, we recommend it for worsted-weight projects crocheted at a more open gauge so that the soft fibers can bloom with blocking.\n\nChroma Twist Worsted is perfect for any project that needs a twist of color: hats and scarves, kid's garments, home decor, and more! And because this yarn is a blend of superwash wool and nylon, your projects will be machine washable too!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Yarn Details\n                    Plus Icon\nMinus Icon\n\n\n\n\nFiber Content:                     70% Superwash Wool, 30% Nylon\n                \nWeight: Worsted\n\nKnitting Gauge:                     4.5 - 5 sts = 1\" on #6 - 9 needles  (4.0mm-5.5mm)\n                \nCrochet Gauge:                     11 - 14 sc = 4'' on I - K hooks (5.5 mm-6.5 mm)\n                \nYards:                     218\n                \nGrams:                     100\n                \nPut Up:                     Ball\n                \nCare:                     Machine Wash Gentle Cold / Tumble Dry Low\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Care Instructions\n                    Plus Icon\nMinus Icon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

With machine washable convenience, Muse Sock Yarn makes it easy to enjoy a whole closet full of garments and accessories just bursting with color.\n\nMuse Sock Yarn is meticulously dyed by Japanese artisans, who blend and apply colors by hand to achieve a range of colors and chromatic explosions.

With just enough alpaca to take best advantage of that downy fiber's warmth and softness, this largely Merino yarn is warm enough for rural winters and soft enough to wear against the skin. Gently spun into a loose twist, the downy fibers are given enough play to provide both thermal efficiency and flattering drape, while still maintaining the structure necessary for excellent stitch definition and durability. Lightly tweedy, neutrally-colored viscose neps are just present enough to create a subtly rustic look without overwhelming. Appropriate for warm sweaters and garments of all sorts, this versatile yarn is soft enough for accessories worn against the skin.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Yarn Details\n                    Plus Icon\nMinus Icon\n\n\n\n\nFiber Content:                     80% Merino Wool, 15% Baby Alpaca, 5% Viscose\n                \nWeight: Aran/Heavy Worsted\n\nKnitting Gauge:                     4 - 4.75 sts = 1\" on #7 - 9 needles (4.5mm-5.5mm)\n                \nCrochet Gauge:                     11 - 14 sc = 4'' on I - K hooks (5.5 mm-6.5 mm)\n                \nYards:                     180\n                \nGrams:                     100\n                \nPut Up:                     Hank\n                \nCare:                     Hand Wash Cold / Lay Flat to Dry\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Care Instructions\n                    Plus Icon\nMinus Icon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

No dyes or bleach are used to process the yarn, keeping the fiber super soft, easy to work with, and sure to bring pleasure to anyone who wears it. The natural white of this pristine state is also an ideal canvas for natural dyes or any other home dyeing adventures; be sure to use a plant fiber-friendly dye process.\n\nDue to the natural state of the yarn, expect a 5-10% shrinkage in the length of the crocheted fabric. Preparing a gauge swatch is highly recommended; wash and dry with your intended care methods to check shrinkage and gauge before crocheting your project.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Yarn Details\n                    Plus Icon\nMinus Icon\n\n\n\n\nFiber Content:                     100% Organic Cotton\n                \nWeight: Worsted\n\nKnitting Gauge:                     4.5 sts = 1\"  on #6 - 9 needles (4.0mm-5.5mm)\n                \nCrochet Gauge:                     11 - 14 sc = 4'' on I - K hooks (5.5 mm-6.5 mm)\n                \nYards:                     164\n                \nGrams:                     100\n                \nPut Up:                     Hank\n                \nCare:                     Machine Wash Gentle Cold / Tumble Dry Low\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Care Instructions\n                    Plus Icon\nMinus Icon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Reducing doesn’t seem like much fun, and reusing generally means you’ve had to rip out a failing project, a painful part of any knitter’s process. Enter Remix, a 100% recycled Berroco yarn made using a low-impact manufacturing process patented in France. \nHOW IS IT MADE?\nGarments and high-quality commercially knit fabric panels left over from the ready-to-wear industry are collected from across Europe and sorted by fiber, then color. Because these pieces are pre-dyed, there is no need to dye them again, which saves water and prevents water pollution. Instead, colors are created by carefully blending garnetted fibers. Garnetted fiber is the result of shredding old textiles to make a new, fleece-like fiber that is ready to be spun into a new yarn.\nRemix and Remix Light use a soft, comfortable blend of nylon, cotton, acrylic, silk, and linen. A tweedy, rustic look makes these yarns ideal candidates for casual knits, and their machine washability means any garment will be low maintenance and hard-wearing. The original Remix comes in an abundant 216-yard ball and knits to a worsted weight gauge, while Remix Light knits to a DK weight gauge and contains an incredible 432 yards per 100g ball. Finished garments are immediately cozy, with the feeling of well-loved jeans or your favorite old t-shirt.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Yarn Details\n                    Plus Icon\nMinus Icon\n\n\n\n\nFiber Content:                     30% Nylon, 27% Cotton, 24% Acrylic, 10% Silk, 9% Linen\n                \nWeight: DK\n\nKnitting Gauge:                     5.5 sts = 1\" on #5 needles (3.75mm)\n                \nCrochet Gauge:                     5 sc = 1\" on F-5 hook (3.75mm)\n                \nYards:                     432\n                \nGrams:                     100\n                \nPut Up:                     Skein\n                \nCare:                     Machine Wash / Dry Flat\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Care Instructions\n                    Plus Icon\nMinus Icon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Standing out from a sturdy core of Merino and nylon, the loops and whorls of Superfine alpaca will obscure delicate lace and intricately textured stitches, but what is lost in stitch definition is gained in coziness. Perfect for next-to-skin accessories and lightweight garments in simple stitches, try holding double with another fingering weight yarn to add delicious texture to your next project.\nBubbly Bouclé was formerly known as Alpaca-Merino Bouclé and was classified as a fingering weight yarn. In addition to giving it a new name, we’ve reclassified it as sport-weight yarn based on customer feedback. The bare colorway may come with the old Alpaca-Merino Bouclé labels, but it's the same great yarn. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Yarn Details\n                    Plus Icon\nMinus Icon\n\n\n\n\nFiber Content:                     82% Superfine Alpaca, 13% Merino Wool, 5% Nylon\n                \nWeight: Sport\n\nKnitting Gauge:                     4.25 - 5.5 sts = 1\" on #4 - 7 needles (3.5mm-4.5mm)\n                \nCrochet Gauge:                     22 - 24 sc = 4'' on E - G hooks (3.5mm-4.0mm)\n                \nYards:                     328\n                \nGrams:                     100\n                \nPut Up:                     Hank\n                \nCare:                     Hand Wash Cold / Lay Flat to Dry\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Care Instructions\n                    Plus Icon\nMinus Icon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

With its exceptional warmth, softness, durability, and versatility, this blend offers stitchers the opportunity to create beautiful, long-lasting garments and accessories that are as stylish as they are comfortable. \n\nBy combining kid mohair with merino wool, we have created a yarn that not only feels luxurious but also boasts exceptional durability and wearability. Mohair's fine fibers, when blended with merino wool, result in a yarn that is stronger and more resilient than pure mohair. This ensures that the knitted items retain their shape and integrity even after repeated use and washing.\nWhether crafting cozy winter sweaters, lightweight summer tops, or stylish accessories, our blend offers the perfect balance of warmth, breathability, and comfort for year-round wear.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Yarn Details\n                    Plus Icon\nMinus Icon\n\n\n\n\nFiber Content:                     75% Merino Wool, 25% Kid Mohair\n                \nWeight: DK\n\nKnitting Gauge:                     5.5 - 6 sts =1\" on #4 - 7 needles (3.5mm - 4.5mm)\n                \nCrochet Gauge:                     13 - 18 sts = 4\" on 7-I hooks (4.5mm - 5.5mm)\n                \nYards:                     273\n                \nGrams:                     100\n                \nPut Up:                     Hank\n                \nCare:                     Hand Wash Cold / Lay Flat to Dry\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Care Instructions\n                    Plus Icon\nMinus Icon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Samia glides through your fingers as you work each stitch making it as much a pleasure to work with as to wear. A sensational blend of two fibers perfectly matched to keep you cool through the warm days. With a slight shine to the yarn, you are able to make garments that drape perfectly for seasonal wear.\n\nCupro is a type of rayon made from a by-product of cotton production. It is made from lint-like fibers and other cotton waste that can't be spun into cotton yarns. Instead, these fibers are chemically treated in a closed system in Japan and processed to produce a super-soft yarn with beautiful drape and shine. Mixed with a bit of Mulberry silk, this yarn is perfect for beautiful lightweight tops & accessories.\n\nWe recommend wet-blocking projects made with Samia. High heat from steaming too close to the project can damage the cupro.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Yarn Details\n                    Plus Icon\nMinus Icon\n\n\n\n\nFiber Content:                     80% Cupro, 20% Mulberry Silk\n                \nWeight: Fingering\n\nKnitting Gauge:                     7 - 8 sts = 1\" on #1 - 3 needles (2.25mm-3.25mm)\n                \nCrochet Gauge:                     24 - 26 sts = 4'' on C - E hooks (2.75-3.5mm)\n                \nYards:                     188\n                \nGrams:                     50\n                \nPut Up:                     Ball\n                \nCare:                     Hand Wash Cold / Lay Flat to Dry\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Care Instructions\n                    Plus Icon\nMinus Icon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

No dyes or bleach are used to process the yarn, keeping the fiber super soft, easy to work with, and sure to bring pleasure to anyone who wears it. The natural white of this pristine state is also an ideal canvas for natural dyes or any other home dyeing adventures; be sure to use plant fiber-friendly dye process.\n\nDue to the natural state of the yarn, expect a 5-10% shrinkage in length of knitted fabric. Preparing a gauge swatch is highly recommended, washing and drying with your intended care methods in order to check shrinkage and gauge before knitting your project.\n\nIn fingering weight, this yarn is good for summer shawls and breathable accessories. Also available in worsted and sport weights.\n\nImmersion, hand-painting, and more will work well on this base when using a dye for plant fibers. We recommend testing dye techniques on a mini skein before dyeing a larger quantity. Use our natural yarns and try dyeing for the first time by following the directions in Jacquard® Dye Tutorial. or our Gradated Dyeing Tutorial.\n\nWe have Jacquard Acid Dyes available in a wide range of colors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Yarn Details\n                    Plus Icon\nMinus Icon\n\n\n\n\nFiber Content:                     100% Organic Cotton\n                \nWeight: Fingering\n\nKnitting Gauge:                     7 - 8 sts = 1 on #1-3 needles (2.25mm - 3.25mm)\n                \nCrochet Gauge:                     21 - 23 sc = 4'' on B - E hooks (2.25mm-3.5mm)\n                \nYards:                     437\n                \nGrams:                     100\n                \nPut Up:                     Hank\n                \nCare:                     Machine Wash Gentle Cold / Tumble Dry Low\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Care Instructions\n                    Plus Icon\nMinus Icon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Three plies of super soft Merino are tightly twisted together, resulting in a dense and springy yarn with tons of definition and body. Because of this compact construction, the yardage and weight can be misleading, with a lot more grams of merino goodness packed into each yard. At 20.5 microns, the fine grade Merino is particularly soft as well as superwash, for added machine washable convenience. The compact plying makes this yarn particularly resistant to pilling and more able to withstand the rigors of the washing machine, making it ideal for next-to-skin accessories like cowls, scarves, and hats or lighter garments that you'll want to touch.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Yarn Details\n                    Plus Icon\nMinus Icon\n\n\n\n\nFiber Content:                     100% Superwash Merino Wool\n                \nWeight: Worsted\n\nKnitting Gauge:                     4 - 4.5 sts = 1\" on 6 - 9 US needles\n                \nCrochet Gauge:                     11 - 14 sts sc = 4\" on I - K hooks\n                \nYards:                     149\n                \nGrams:                     100\n                \nPut Up:                     Hank\n                \nCare:                     Machine Wash Gentle Cold / Tumble Dry Low\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Care Instructions\n                    Plus Icon\nMinus Icon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

This 80/20 blend of merino and alpaca strikes a harmonious balance between rustic warmth and refined elegance. With just enough alpaca to enhance its softness and thermal efficiency, this mostly Merino yarn is ideal for cold woodland winters while still being gentle against the skin.\nGently spun with a loose twist, Woodland provides excellent drape and insulation while maintaining the structure needed for durable, well-defined stitches.

Reducing doesn’t seem like much fun, and reusing generally means you’ve had to rip out a failing project, a painful part of any knitter’s process. Enter Remix, a 100% recycled Berroco yarn made using a low-impact manufacturing process patented in France. \nHOW IS IT MADE?\nGarments and high-quality commercially knit fabric panels left over from the ready-to-wear industry are collected from across Europe and sorted by fiber, then color. Because these pieces are pre-dyed, there is no need to dye them again, which saves water and prevents water pollution. Instead, colors are created by carefully blending garnetted fibers. Garnetted fiber is the result of shredding old textiles to make a new, fleece-like fiber that is ready to be spun into a new yarn.\nRemix and Remix Light use a soft, comfortable blend of nylon, cotton, acrylic, silk, and linen. A tweedy, rustic look makes these yarns ideal candidates for casual knits, and their machine washability means any garment will be low maintenance and hard-wearing. The original Remix comes in an abundant 216-yard ball and knits to a worsted weight gauge, while Remix Light knits to a DK weight gauge and contains an incredible 432 yards per 100g ball. Finished garments are immediately cozy, with the feeling of well-loved jeans or your favorite old t-shirt.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Yarn Details\n                    Plus Icon\nMinus Icon\n\n\n\n\nFiber Content:                     30% Nylon, 27% Cotton, 24% Acrylic, 10% Silk, 9% Linen\n                \nWeight: Worsted\n\nKnitting Gauge:                     4.25 sts = 1\" on #8 needles (5mm)\n                \nCrochet Gauge:                     3.5 sc = 1\" on H-9 hooks (5mm)\n                \nYards:                     216\n                \nGrams:                     100\n                \nPut Up:                     Skein\n                \nCare:                     Machine Wash / Dry Flat\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Care Instructions\n                    Plus Icon\nMinus Icon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Tanguis (tan-gwiss) cotton has a very soft hand, excellent absorption, and, because it is a naturally white fiber, a high affinity for dyes. The Belgian linen adds characteristic flecks and additional absorbency with very low elasticity - helping to alleviate stretching in the finished project. Summer linen has an extended growing period which results in a longer, stronger fiber. When blended with the already strong Tanguis cotton, it makes a durable, wearable, and soft yarn. The crocheted fabric will get softer with each wash too.\n\nNote: For best results, choose a dyeing method that works with plant-based fibers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Yarn Details\n                    Plus Icon\nMinus Icon\n\n\n\n\nFiber Content:                     70% Tanguis Cotton, 30% Linen\n                \nWeight: DK\n\nKnitting Gauge:                     5.5 sts = 1 on #5 - 7 needles (3.75mm - 4.5mm)\n                \nCrochet Gauge:                     12 - 17 sc = 4'' on 7-I hooks (4.5mm - 5.5mm)\n                \nYards:                     246\n                \nGrams:                     100\n                \nPut Up:                     Hank\n                \nCare:                     Machine Wash Gentle Cold / Tumble Dry Low\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Care Instructions\n                    Plus Icon\nMinus Icon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

The high-quality Tanguis (tan-gwiss) cotton has a very soft hand, excellent absorption, and, because it is a naturally white fiber, a high affinity for dyes.

Three plies of super soft Merino are tightly twisted together, resulting in a dense and springy yarn with tons of definition and body. Because of this compact construction, the yardage and weight can be misleading, with a lot more grams of merino goodness packed into each yard. At 20.5 microns, the fine grade Merino is particularly soft as well as superwash, for added machine washable convenience. The compact plying makes this yarn particularly resistant to pilling and more able to withstand the rigors of the washing machine, making it ideal for next-to-skin accessories like cowls, scarves, and hats or lighter garments that you'll want to touch.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Yarn Details\n                    Plus Icon\nMinus Icon\n\n\n\n\nFiber Content:                     100% Superwash Merino Wool\n                \nWeight: Worsted\n\nKnitting Gauge:                     4 - 4.5 sts = 1\" on 6 - 9 US needles\n                \nCrochet Gauge:                     11 - 14 sts sc = 4\" on I - K hooks\n                \nYards:                     14\n                \nGrams:                     10\n                \nPut Up:                     Mini Hank\n                \nCare:                     Machine Wash Gentle Cold / Tumble Dry Low\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Care Instructions\n                    Plus Icon\nMinus Icon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

With just enough alpaca to take best advantage of that downy fiber's warmth and softness, this largely Merino yarn is warm enough for rural winters and soft enough to wear against the skin. Gently spun into a loose twist, the downy fibers are given enough play to provide both thermal efficiency and flattering drape, while still maintaining the structure necessary for excellent stitch definition and durability. Lightly tweedy, neutrally-colored viscose neps are just present enough to create a subtly rustic look without overwhelming. Appropriate for warm sweaters and garments of all sorts, this versatile yarn is soft enough for accessories worn against the skin.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Yarn Details\n                    Plus Icon\nMinus Icon\n\n\n\n\nFiber Content:                     80% Merino Wool, 15% Baby Alpaca, 5% Viscose\n                \nWeight: Aran/Heavy Worsted\n\nKnitting Gauge:                     4 - 4.75 sts = 1\" on #7 - 9 needles (4.5mm-5.5mm)\n                \nCrochet Gauge:                     11 - 14 sc = 4'' on I - K hooks (5.5 mm-6.5 mm)\n                \nYards:                     18\n                \nGrams:                     10\n                \nPut Up:                     Mini Hank\n                \nCare:                     Hand Wash Cold / Lay Flat to Dry\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Care Instructions\n                    Plus Icon\nMinus Icon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Bluefaced Leicester provides luster, drape, and durability; Masham provides a hint of sheen and loftiness; and Merino provides luxurious softness. This luxury British breed blend is a staple yarn in any stash, with each shade inspired by English woodland. This soft yarn is comfortably worn next to the skin, making it ideal for sweaters, scarves, and hats.\nBluefaced Leicester: Evolved during the last century in the Tyne & Wear Valleys and the hills of east Cumbria, this breed produces fine, long-staple wool that is known for its softness and luster. As well as being soft, this fiber also holds the strength needed to create long-lasting garments that can be treasured over time. With a broad muzzle and tightly curled, semi-lustrous wool, it is the dark blue skin on the sheep’s head that gave the breed its name.\nMasham: Produced by crossing a Teeswater or Wensleydale ram with a Northern hill ewe such as the Swaledale or Dalesbred, this hardy sheep produces a soft, demi-luster fleece.\nMerino: Developed in Spain, Merino sheep are world famous for having one of the highest quality fleece of any breed of sheep. The short and fine fibers used in Merino yarn create a luxurious and soft texture that has all the resilience needed to create a long-lasting piece of knitwear.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Yarn Details\n                    Plus Icon\nMinus Icon\n\n\n\n\nFiber Content:                     34% Blue Faced Leicester, 33% Masham, 33% Merino\n                \nWeight: Aran/Heavy Worsted\n\nKnitting Gauge:                     4 - 4.75 sts = 1\" on #7 - 9 needles (4.5mm-5.5mm)\n                \nCrochet Gauge:                     11 -14 sc = 4'' on I - K hooks (5.5mm-6.5mm)\n                \nYards:                     168\n                \nGrams:                     100\n                \nPut Up:                     Hank\n                \nCare:                     Hand Wash / Dry Flat\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Care Instructions\n                    Plus Icon\nMinus Icon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

This superwash worsted weight Merino wool yarn is our first-ever exclusive yarn crafted in Japan. The wonderfully soft and touchable merino is firmly twisted in a single strand, stable enough to discourage splitting and pilling while still enjoying the finish and drape of single-ply construction, with special care taken to ensure even thickness. At approx. 8 wraps per inch, the yard-to-weight ratio can be deceiving, with extra weight from the dense twist knitting into a satisfying and substantial fabric.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Yarn Details\n                    Plus Icon\nMinus Icon\n\n\n\n\nFiber Content:                     100% Superwash Merino Wool\n                \nWeight: Aran/Heavy Worsted\n\nKnitting Gauge:                     4 - 4.5 sts = 1\" on #7 -10 needles (4.5mm-5.5mm)\n                \nCrochet Gauge:                     11 - 14 sc = 4\" on I - K hooks\n                \nYards:                     114\n                \nGrams:                     100\n                \nPut Up:                     Hank\n                \nCare:                     Machine Wash Gentle Cold / Tumble Dry Low\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Care Instructions\n                    Plus Icon\nMinus Icon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Bluefaced Leicester provides luster, drape, and durability; Masham provides a hint of sheen and loftiness; and Merino provides luxurious softness. This luxury British breed blend is a staple yarn in any stash, with each shade inspired by English woodland. This soft yarn is comfortably worn next to the skin, making it ideal for sweaters, scarves, and hats.\nBluefaced Leicester: Evolved during the last century in the Tyne & Wear Valleys and the hills of east Cumbria, this breed produces fine, long-staple wool that is known for its softness and luster. As well as being soft, this fiber also holds the strength needed to create long-lasting garments that can be treasured over time. With a broad muzzle and tightly curled, semi-lustrous wool, it is the dark blue skin on the sheep’s head that gave the breed its name.\nMasham: Produced by crossing a Teeswater or Wensleydale ram with a Northern hill ewe such as the Swaledale or Dalesbred, this hardy sheep produces a soft, demi-luster fleece.\nMerino: Developed in Spain, Merino sheep are world famous for having one of the highest quality fleece of any breed of sheep. The short and fine fibers used in Merino yarn create a luxurious and soft texture that has all the resilience needed to create a long-lasting piece of knitwear.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Yarn Details\n                    Plus Icon\nMinus Icon\n\n\n\n\nFiber Content:                     34% Blue Faced Leicester, 33% Masham, 33% Merino\n                \nWeight: DK\n\nKnitting Gauge:                     6 sts = 1\" on #3 - 5 needles (3.25mm-3.75mm)\n                \nCrochet Gauge:                     19 sc = 4\" on G-6 hook (4.0mm)\n                \nYards:                     223\n                \nGrams:                     100\n                \nPut Up:                     Hank\n                \nCare:                     Hand Wash Cold / Lay Flat to Dry\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Care Instructions\n                    Plus Icon\nMinus Icon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Three plies of super soft Merino are tightly twisted together, resulting in a dense and springy yarn with tons of definition and body. Because of this compact construction, the yardage and weight can be misleading, with a lot more grams of merino goodness packed into each yard. At 20.5 microns, the fine grade Merino is particularly soft as well as superwash, for added machine washable convenience. \nThe compact plying makes this yarn particularly resistant to pilling and more able to withstand the rigors of the washing machine, making it ideal for next-to-skin accessories like cowls, scarves, and hats or lighter garments that you'll want to touch. Immersion, hand-painting, and more will work well on this base, and 100% superwash wool will take dye all the way down to the core of the fiber to achieve rich, vibrant colors. We recommend testing dye techniques on a mini skein before dyeing a larger quantity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Yarn Details\n                    Plus Icon\nMinus Icon\n\n\n\n\nFiber Content:                     100% Fine Superwash Merino Wool\n                \nWeight: Fingering\n\nKnitting Gauge:                     7 - 8 sts = 1\" on #1 - 3 needles (2.25mm-3.25mm)\n                \nCrochet Gauge:                     21 - 23 sc = 4'' on B - E hooks (2.25mm-3.5mm)\n                \nYards:                     366\n                \nGrams:                     100\n                \nPut Up:                     Hank\n                \nCare:                     Machine Wash Gentle Cold / Tumble Dry Low\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Care Instructions\n                    Plus Icon\nMinus Icon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
