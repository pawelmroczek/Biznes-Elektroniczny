This organization's vision is to inspire donations of bar soap to local food pantries, homeless shelters, social service agencies, and veterans clinics. By crocheting a soap sack and pairing it with a sealed bar of soap, you can give essential toiletries and a lovingly handmade item to those who need them. Find out more at soapsacks.com\nThis pattern is fun to crochet, and results in a soap sack with a scrubby side, thanks to the bobble stitches on the front. The bobbles provide a focal point, and a catalyst for creativity as you mix and match yarns to create unique soap sacks. You'll want to make these for gifts as well as donations to deserving organizations.\nSee more pattern details here: Bobble Soap Sack\n",
